    <p>Yesterday I attended <a href="http://www.onedotzero.com/">onedotzero</a> at the British Film Institute. I was invited by <a href="http://alphalabs.cc">alphalabs.cc</a> to their launch event, in conjunction with Microsoft and Nokia.</p><p>It was pitched as "an experiment that merges technology and the arts" - and this blend (to me at least) is intriguing. Since I discovered "creative coding" I have been fascinated by the experimental applications that fit in this space, so didn't want to miss out on this event. <em>I have no idea how I got an invite... I wonder if it was because I'm a Nokia dev member, or because I have previously been active on the oF forums, or maybe I was just very lucky.</em></p><p>Some marketing and community/dev evangelist type people talked for a bit, and they weren't over the top with pushing WP7.5 - which was good. There was a lot of talk about the lineage of the Metro design (that I found very interesting) - Metro is a relatively unique looking interface, and has some new ideas and interactions in it - so it was nice to hear how it was conceived.</p><p>Then, they pulled up 3 teams of developers and designers to talk about the applications they had made over the last two weeks - essentially showcasing the WP7.5 development environment (ease of use, speed, different technologies etc). This was the most interesting part for me. The applications were</p><ol><li>a music app that collaboratively generated music across 4 synchronised phones - <a href="http://www.alphalabs.cc/project/69-vequencer">Vequencer</a></li><li>a music video/game in which you take the form of a 3D shape and can shift gravity and change shapes to navigate through the levels - <a href="http://www.alphalabs.cc/project/70-redshift">Redshift</a></li><li>a kaleidoscope app merging video and generative art that changes based on environmental factors such as motion and sound - <a href="http://www.alphalabs.cc/project/68-kaleidobooth">Kaleidobooth</a></li></ol><p>The applications themselves were quite impressive, but what impressed me more is that the team that did the second app (<a href="http://www.field.io/">Field</a>, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>, and <a href="http://xna-uk.net/blogs/braindump/default.aspx">Ed</a> from the XNA Users Group) had no experience with the WP7 <del>or XNA</del> development environments previously, and managed to create a 3D game in 2 weeks, with excellent graphics and sound. Very impressed.</p><p>And to top it all off, I got a free phone :-) Nokia Lumia 800 - it's actually really nice. Screen is brilliant.</p><p>AND alphalabs are running a little competition too - app development - cash prizes. Doesn't appear to be on their website yet, but I recall it closes in early Jan-2012.</p><hr /><p>(Update 20111128 - Ed from XNA User Group was also part of team two - thanks for the update Tristan!)</p>
