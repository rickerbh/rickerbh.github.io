    <p>Given I'm really digging clojure at the moment, I thought I'd port my blog over from octopress to a clojure based static site generator. I wanted something that supported the same sort of structure, with markdown, and low hassle on getting it running. <a href="https://cryogenweb.org/">Cryogen</a> seemed to be the best documented and most modern of the few I could find.</p><p>The process to port it over was as follows</p><ul><li>Setup the right values in <code>content/config.edn</code></li><li>Port some content</li><li>Setup deployment</li></ul><h2 id="config">Config</h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/rickerbh/blog/blob/0ab0bd8250ab78a31d75db501892cddb9b13a7a6/content/config.edn">config file</a> was trivial. The only bits that needed tweaking were the blog-prefix (I want all content at the root so <code>/</code> is right for me), <code>page-root-uri</code> (needed to make it empty string so pages are at existing URLs), and the <code>post-root-uri</code>. The last is a bit trickier - I couldn't find a way to support the existing post structure (wordpress style, with <code>/yyyy/MM/dd/post-name</code>), but that doesn't worry me too much. Also needed to add my custom historic uploads directory in to <code>:resources</code> array.</p><h2 id="port-the-content">Port the content</h2><p>For content porting, this was a bit trickier. Cryogen requires front-matter to be in a clojure map, but octopress supported the frontmatter as yaml. So, I wrote a short (it was short, until I needed to deal with the edge cases) <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/">babashka</a> script to do this. The script will take a directory of posts (including subdirs), read, and reformat them for cryogen. Basically they port the frontmatter into clojure maps, and filter out unsupported keys.</p><p>Script available at: <a href="https://gist.github.com/rickerbh/4bcc3b3243e0f271b9ca3c8e16028948">octopress-to-cryogen.clj</a></p><h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2><p>I was using github-pages to serve the existing site. The deployment process I had was a hassle. When I set it up I wrote a custom script that I'd need to run on my local machine to build then deploy the site to the special repo/branch to get github to deploy it. I'd always forget what the order of commands were, how I needed to init the ruby environment (did I use dotenv, or bundle, or both, or something else?), it was always a hassle.</p><p>I've used a number of different CI/automation systems (Jenkins, Travis, and CircleCI), but wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn a bit about GitHub Actions. I needed the configuration script to handle building a clojure project, and then deploying it to gh-pages. This required plugging together a few actions, but I didn't need to write any custom code for this. Everything I needed already existed, and needed to be coupled together.</p><p>The setup for the clojure part of the project just required following instructions at <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-clojure">https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-clojure</a>, and the publishing to gh-pages part at <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action">https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action</a>. The trickiest part was determining that because I'm publishing a "user" based page, I needed to use the <code>personal_token</code> and <code>external_repository</code> config.</p><p>GitHub Actions deployment script available at <a href="https://github.com/rickerbh/blog/blob/0ab0bd8250ab78a31d75db501892cddb9b13a7a6/.github/workflows/workflow.yml">workflow.yml</a></p><h2 id="end">End</h2><p>I <em>do</em> want to blog more - I enjoy it, and fingers crossed this simpler setup helps me do so.</p><p>Hopefully this helps you configure up cryogen for automated deployment via github actions, or the script to port content is useful!</p>
