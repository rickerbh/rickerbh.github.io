<meta name="description" content="Well, last friday (29th) was my last day at Vodafone Group Services.  It feels a bit weird not working there anymore, although I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s really hit me.  After 8+ years in the same group of companies it&#39;s just a bit strange to be out.I&#39;ve got a new role at a consultancy based in London, starting with some intensive training on the 10th March.  Should be very interesting to start working on the other side of the consultant/customer relationship.  I&#39;m really looking forward to it - it&#39;ll be great to be able to interact with a wider range of companies, industries and perform a much more cross-functional role.  It should be great!  And finally being able to feel like I&#39;m delivering value to people and organisations again - that will be the most rewarding part of the move (of course, I have been delivering value for the past 8 years, it&#39;s just in the last 2 it&#39;s been in a very different way - all advice and recommendations, rather than something tangible).">

    <p>Well, last friday (29th) was my last day at <a href="http://www.vodafone.com/">Vodafone Group Services</a>.  It feels a bit weird not working there anymore, although I don't even know if it's really hit me.  After 8+ years in the same group of companies it's just a bit strange to be out.</p><p>I've got a new role at a consultancy based in London, starting with some intensive training on the 10th March.  Should be very interesting to start working on the other side of the consultant/customer relationship.  I'm really looking forward to it - it'll be great to be able to interact with a wider range of companies, industries and perform a much more cross-functional role.  It should be great!  And finally being able to feel like I'm delivering value to people and organisations again - that will be the most rewarding part of the move (of course, I <em>have</em> been delivering value for the past 8 years, it's just in the last 2 it's been in a very different way - all advice and recommendations, rather than something tangible).</p><p>The biggest thing that I think I'm going to struggle with though is having to pay for phone calls!  Spending a long time with free wireless voice and data services builds up some bad habits (from my bank balances point of view!)</p>
