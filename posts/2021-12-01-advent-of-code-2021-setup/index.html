<meta name="description" content="One of the issues with getting started with a new language in a time-pressured scenario is setting up environment and tooling. Last year I used VSCode and the ReasonML plugin. It installed relatively straight-forwardly (from what I remember), and supported type hints, and autocompletion. This year I decided I&#39;d setup Emacs, given I use it for everything else. Long story short - what an utter shambles. I tried to follow the installation guide for the Real World OCaml book plus the Prelude OCaml support (I use Prelude with Emacs, due to the great Clojure support it has). It was generally a struggle to get the extensions to handle resolving imports of local files, as well as 3rd party libraries imported via opam. I gave up and went back to VSCode. The plugin setup was straightforward, but I still struggle with being able to actually run a program. I use the utop repl(like) interface to evaluate the statements in my program files, but even that wasn&#39;t that simple. Needing to deal with merlin and dune config files just to get my files recognised feels like a bunch of unnecessary complexity. I need to resolve this (and I&#39;d still love to get it all working in emacs), but I can limp along with what I&#39;ve currently got.Anyway, puzzle 1, step 1 - my solution for this was to run a reducing function over the array, incrementing a counter when a new value is greater than the prior value. It required 2 functions to be created to execute and produce the answer. The input needs to be a list of ints as well.">

    <p>One of the issues with getting started with a new language in a time-pressured scenario is setting up environment and tooling. Last year I used VSCode and the <a href="https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vscode-reasonml">ReasonML plugin</a>. It installed relatively straight-forwardly (from what I remember), and supported type hints, and autocompletion. This year I decided I'd setup Emacs, given I use it for everything else. Long story short - what an utter shambles. I tried to follow the <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/install.html">installation guide</a> for the Real World OCaml book plus the Prelude OCaml support (I use Prelude with Emacs, due to the great Clojure support it has). It was generally a struggle to get the extensions to handle resolving imports of local files, as well as 3rd party libraries imported via opam. I gave up and went back to VSCode.
