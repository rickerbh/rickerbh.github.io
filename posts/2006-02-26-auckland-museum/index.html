<meta name="description" content="Went to the Museum here today.  I was astounded.  It is so very good.  I&#39;ve been living here for just over 6 years now and had never been.  My mate Dave asked me if I wanted to go to see the Da Vinci machines exhibition and I am quite keen to see that.  Anyway, I met him down at Santos (a local cafe), we had a late lunch, bit of a chat then made our way down to the Auckland War Memorial Museum.  We arrived down there at about 3.  After a quick chat to the guy who was taking the $5 donation to get in, we discovered that the line for the exhibition was about 1 hour long...  So, we decided to have a look around the rest of the place then check out the line again.  It&#39;s a very good museum.  Anyway, we were having a look around, about a 1/3 of the way around the 3rd floor they announced that the place was closing in 5 minutes.  We didn&#39;t even get to see the whole place.  Anyway, I&#39;d be quite keen to go back, and the Da Vinci machines closes on the 5th of March.  It has late night on Wednesday, so perhaps that&#39;s a plan for after work.I&#39;ve gotta check out more places of cultural significance in this city.  I think next on the list will be the Art Gallery.">

    <p>Went to the Museum here today.  I was astounded.  It is so very good.  I've been living here for just over 6 years now and had never been.  My mate Dave asked me if I wanted to go to see the Da Vinci machines exhibition and I am quite keen to see that.  Anyway, I met him down at Santos (a local cafe), we had a late lunch, bit of a chat then made our way down to the Auckland War Memorial Museum.  We arrived down there at about 3.

So, we decided to have a look around the rest of the place then check out the line again.  It's a very good museum.  Anyway, we were having a look around, about a 1/3 of the way around the 3rd floor they announced that the place was closing in 5 minutes.  We didn't even get to see the whole place.  Anyway, I'd be quite keen to go back, and the Da Vinci machines closes on the 5th of March.
