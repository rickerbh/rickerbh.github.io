    <p>I try to do at least some of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> puzzles each year. Usually I get a few days in then other pressures come up and I have to bail, but I use the puzzles as an opportunity to try out programming languages that are new to me, or ones I want to become more familiar with. Last year I attempted to use OCaml. This went OK for a couple of days, but then we moved internationally and were locked in a hotel room for 2 weeks with young kids, so AoC was the first thing to go out the window.</p><p>This year I'm looking to use <a href="https://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> again to solve the puzzles - I didn't give it a fair shake last year. I've had a bit of experience with ML-style languages via Haskell, so I'm hoping the learning curve isn't too steep.</p><p>I'm terrible at keeping on top of this blog, but I'd like to document the process I go through with learning this language via the puzzles.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p>
