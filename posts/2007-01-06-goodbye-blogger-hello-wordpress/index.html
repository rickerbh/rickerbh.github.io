    <p>Well, I've just spent the last wee while migrating my account from <a href="http://rickerbh.blogspot.com">http://rickerbh.blogspot.com</a> to <a href="http://blog.hamishrickerby.com">http://blog.hamishrickerby.com</a> So, you'll now be reading this on my fancy new self-hosted <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> instance.</p><p>The migration process was relatively simple. <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a> made it a piece of cake for the installation process, I only had a small issue with the migration of my data across.  It was only yesterday that I upgraded my blogger account from the old version, to their new (no longer beta) version, and changed all my templates as well.  Because of this, I couldn't use the automatic import facility on WordPress as it doesn't yet support the new blogger.  I checked out a couple of articles on the web on how to import between the two, but the BEST thing I found to do (and this is suitable for me because I don't really mind that I lost comments on my blog) was export all the articles as 1 large RSS feed, and them import them back into wordpress.  Blogger confused me a little because the default RSS feed didn't support all of my comments, but I found that using the following URL, I could get all the data out that I needed</p><blockquote><span style="font-family:monospace;"> http://YOUR_BLOG_HERE.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?start-index=1&amp;max-results=999&amp;alt=rss</span>Â </blockquote>
That downloads your last 999 posts, starting at the first.  If you have more than that, then  you write too much, and you can just play with the start-index value to get the rest.
<p>So, as part of this change I have resolved to write more - and write more things about me, rather than just reviews on albums and movies.  And to facilitate this, I've decided to give the <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">ecto</a> blogging client.  We'll see how it goes.  I've got 20 days to try it out, so expect a few more updates from me over the next 3 weeks.</p><p>So, I'm also going to alter the graphics on this site, but that can be done a bit later.  The default ones are quite nice, but I have something in mind that I'd like to see implemented.</p><p>Oh, and if you had <a href="http://hamishrickerby.com/blog/feed/">subscribed</a> to my last blog, you'll need to resubscribe.  This one has a nice new feed for you.</p>
