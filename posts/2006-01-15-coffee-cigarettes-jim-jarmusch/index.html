I knew it was going to be black and white, but that&#39;s about it.  I found the first couple of scenes to be a bit odd.  I quite liked the scene with Jack and Meg White and the Tesla Coil, but my favourite had to be RZA, GZA (of Wu Tang fame) and Bill Murray.  I thought that was hilarious.  I also quite enjoyed the tie ins from scenes to other scenes.My favourite quotes â€“ please forgive me if I don&#39;t get them 100% â€“ it is from memory:">
