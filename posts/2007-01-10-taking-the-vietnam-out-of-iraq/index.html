<meta name="description" content="Taking the Vietnam out of IraqJenna sent me a link to this story on the BBC web site - it&#39;s interesting.  The parallels between the conflict in Vietnam and Iraq are clear to me.  However, an exit strategy for this current conflict needs to be carefully executed.  A cut-and-run is not an option.  The country will be left open, and crippled.  I personally would like the US out of there as soon as possible, not because I have any specific alliance to Iraq, but I just don&#39;t think they should be creating and sustaining an unjust and illegal war.  I am an advocate of a medium paced exit, with creation of stability within the country, and leaving it in a state so that it has a good chance of sorting itself out with a positive result.  I don&#39;t fancy the chances of a positive result if they just up and leave.">

The parallels between the conflict in Vietnam and Iraq are clear to me.  However, an exit strategy for this current conflict needs to be carefully executed.  A cut-and-run is not an option.  The country will be left open, and crippled.  I personally would like the US out of there as soon as possible, not because I have any specific alliance to Iraq, but I just don't think they should be creating and sustaining an unjust and illegal war.  I am an advocate of a medium paced exit, with creation of stability within the country, and leaving it in a state so that it has a good chance of sorting itself out with a positive result.  I don't fancy the chances of a positive result if they just up and leave.</p><p>One thing that is very interesting from this story is this quote:</p><blockquote>Second, there is a policy of trying to hand over responsibility to the local government in the midst of battle, not after it - this happened in Vietnam with the policy of Vietnamisation</blockquote><p>I agree there is that parallel, but I don't think that can be helped with the current conflict.  With such a small, radical, underground enemy as the US have in Iraq, it's going to be next to impossible to end the conflict, and then hand responsibility back.</p><p>I don't believe another push by the US to destroy the insurgents is the way forward.  That will breed more hate and contempt for the US in the country.</p><p>Any comments?</p><br />
