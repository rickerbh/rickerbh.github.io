Couldn&#39;t answer any of the first 7 questions - bloody current affairs, and local sports.  Why do I pay so little attention to local sports.  It&#39;s really because I just don&#39;t care about how local team x is going against foreign team y.  Proletariats and their distractions I guess.  And then we stayed for the open mic night.  First lady was depressing, 2nd dude was alright.  3rd dude was this freaky modern beatnik poet - so random.  4th was this dude who was quite good.  last we saw was this lady who&#39;s stage demeanor was equivalent to that of Jewel.  She was a really good singer too.  I[&#39;d buy her CD if she released one.Tomas and Jon went off to the Drake.  I went home.  I&#39;ve got a conference call with VFUK in the morning (urrrg, 7-am) about a job.  Fingers crossed.">
