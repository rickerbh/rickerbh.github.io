<meta name="description" content="What a strange movie.  With my job I have recently been on a cross-cultural training course, the objective of which was to enable you to understand drivers of behaviour in different cultures.  What was particularly interesting about this to me was the way that the foreigners learnt the strange new culture, and how the changes stuck with them.  And i guess trying to understand (as an observer) what is going thru the foreigners heads.  Perhaps it would have been more clear to me if I lived in the USSR (as it was known) in the 1980’s…Anyway, very good movie, Russian language so there’s a bit of reading for non-russian speakers like me, well worth it.Koo!">
