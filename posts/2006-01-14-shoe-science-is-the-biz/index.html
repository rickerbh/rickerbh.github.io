<meta name="description" content="Back from my shoe shopping excursion.  My mate Kurt said I should go down to Shoe Science and get fitted for a pair of shoes.  It’s quite interesting how they fit you.  They have this camera and a DVD recorder, and a little running track.  You run up and down the track 3 times, and they record your legs running.  Then you watch the video, and check out the ankle movement.  They then can choose a shoe that will correct your ankle roll.  The theory is that the shoes you get from there will be biomechanically correct, and they will lower the chance of injury.Anyway, I found some shoes that corrected my ankle roll, and they didn’t have the perfect size for me.  They are ordering them in, so on Tuesday (or perhaps even Monday afternoon) I’ll have some new running shoes that no longer hurt me.">
