<meta name="description" content="I got one of the girls I work with to come out sunglasses shopping with me last week.  Went down to a parallel importer on queen street, and they didn’t have anything I was interested in.  I wanted some more fashionable glasses, not sports styled glasses.  I already have some adidas ones, but I felt I needed a change.So, into Sunglass Hut on Queen Street, have a look around, and I get very confused.  I found it very difficult to determine which glasses are for which sex – there are some obvious female-themed glasses, but the mens ones are more difficult to distinguish.  So, I speak to the clerk, and she gets me out quite a few pairs.Long story short, the first pair I try on are the best.  D&amp;G 2075’s.Nice.">
