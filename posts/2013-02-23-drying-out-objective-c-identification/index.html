    <p>I have a large objective-c codebase I've been working on with a client for over a year now. The application started off as a prototype, and transitioned into a demo client, and is currently undergoing modifications for security/penetration testing and commercialization. Initially for the protoype and demo, the objective was to get a working application as quickly as possible - speed of initial development was the key. With the current change in focus to a more productized codebase, and improving maintainability as part of that, I decided I'd actively go hunting for areas in the application that can be tidied up, and particularly, looking for duplicate segments of code and eliminating them where feasible.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY - or Don't Repeat Yourself</a> - is (according to Wikipedia) a <em>principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."</em> ... <em>When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync.</em></p><p>One big problem with a larger code base that has been developed over a long period of time is that you may not know where the duplicate code actually is. You know it's there, you're just not sure where.</p><h2 id="finding-duplicate-code">Finding Duplicate Code</h2><p>What I wanted for DRYing up the code base was for duplicate chunks of code to be identified for me.</p><p>Searching out there I stumbled across a project called <a href="http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian/">Simian</a> - it's a java based tool for identifing duplicate code in a set of different programming languages - one being Objective-C. Simian supports output in a number of different formats - plain text being the default, but also supports an XML based output. The project is available on a 15 day evaluation period, and then should be paid for commercial or enterprise use. A Build Server license costs $499 US.</p><p>Simian can be run against a codebase just by feeding it include/exclude directory and file patterns.</p><pre><code>java -jar simian-2.3.33.jar -excludes=\"External Libraries\" **/*.m **/*.h
</code></pre><p>You can also change the format of the output</p><pre><code>java -jar simian-2.3.33.jar -formatter=xml -excludes=\"External Libraries\" **/*.m **/*.h
</code></pre><p>And even output to a file</p><pre><code>java -jar simian-2.3.33.jar -formatter=xml:simian.xml -excludes=\"External Libraries\" **/*.m **/*.h
</code></pre><h2 id="integration-with-jenkins">Integration with Jenkins</h2><p>I've previously written here about setting up and using Jenkins as a build/CI system with Objective-C/iOS projects, and I really wanted to integrate this duplicate code reporting as part of my standard build process, along with my unit and application test reports.</p><p>To get Simian reports integrated with Jenkins there is a Jenkins extension available called the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/DRY+Plugin">DRY Plugin</a>. Just navigate to your Jenkins instance and click... Manage Jenkins -&gt; Manage Plugins -&gt; Available and type Duplicate in the filter box. The plugin is called "Duplicate Code Scanner Plug-in". Install it.</p><p>To get the Simian process running is really simple. I added a new project that I could trigger after my unit tests have run, called "Code Analysis". This project has a very small number of steps.</p><ol><li>Pull the source from your code repo</li><li>Set a Build Trigger for the project to start after your unit test project has completed. <em>This step isn't necessary, but you need some sort of build trigger. I like mine to work after unit tests as then I know the codebase is in a good state.</em></li><li>Add an Execute Shell task. The task should look something like below</li></ol><p>{% codeblock %}
cd "<Path to="to" your="your" jenkins="jenkins" project="project">/workspace"
git submodule update --recursive --init
echo "#!/bin/bash" &gt; simian.sh
echo "java -jar <Path to="to" your="your" simiar="simiar" jar="jar">/simian-2.3.33.jar -balanceSquareBrackets=true -formatter=xml:simian.xml -excludes="External Libraries" **/<em>.m **/</em>.h" &gt;&gt; simian.sh
echo "exit 0" &gt;&gt; simian.sh
chmod u+x simian.sh
./simian.sh
rm simian.sh
{% endcodeblock %}</Path></Path></p><p>What the above task does is change directory to the correct jenkins workspace, ensure all submodules are updated (if you don't use submodules, you probably won't want this), then create a shell script that runs Simian and exits with a 0 return code, sets the script to be executable, runs the script, then cleans up after itself. The reason why the build task needs to create a shell script to run Simian is because the return code from Java/Simian seems to be interpreted by Jenkins as non-0 i.e. a build failure. You don't want that.</p><p>The <code>-balanceSquareBrackets=true</code> flag to Simian ensures that code that is split across multiple lines inside square brackets is treated as a single unit. It might be a good idea to use the <code>-balanceParentheses=true</code> flag as well to help matching on things like <code>if</code> statements.</p><p>Then it's just a matter of configuring the reporting. If you've installed the DRY plugin correctly, you should be able to add a Post Build Action of "Publish duplicate code analysis results". In the "Duplicate code results" field, type in the path and filename you gave the output XML from simian - in the example above I called mine <code>simian.xml</code>.</p><p>That's it.</p><p>Save and "Build Now" your new project, and after this is complete, click on the project. There should be a fancy trend graph showing Duplicate Code in the upper right of the screen, and a "Duplicate Code" item on the left navigation menu. That will show you all the files with duplicate code chunks, and the other files they are repeated in.</p>
