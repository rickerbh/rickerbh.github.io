<p>I&rsquo;m a dude.  I don&rsquo;t want to look <em>lovely</em>.</p>

<p>This really irks me.  As part of my day job I perform IT system selections.  One thing I know a little bit about is BI/campaign management/analytics software.  It isn&rsquo;t too hard to run a marketing campaign, and choose your messages based on the gender of the person you are trying to entice to purchase your products.  Another option is choosing a subset of customers to market to - <strong>SELECT * FROM customers WHERE gender = &lsquo;f&rsquo;</strong> might have excluded me.</p>

<p>Companies that don&rsquo;t utilise their data well are just wasting an incredible important resource, and potentially creating a bad customer experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">wikipedia</a>)</p>

<blockquote>Getting Things Done, commonly abbreviated as GTD, is an action management method, and the title of a book by David Allen.
GTD rests on the principle that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind by recording them somewhere. That way, the mind is freed from the job of remembering everything that needs to be done, and can concentrate on actually performing those tasks.</blockquote>


<p>I have previously used the GTD method when I was leaving Auckland, so I could ensure that I managed the many tasks I needed to complete to move countries.  Since then, my GTD implementation (based on <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">tracks</a>) slipped back to becoming a home for stagnant tasks.  My tracks implementation was also local to my home machine, and I couldn&rsquo;t use it for my day job.  I also had a couple of usability issues with tracks (which I <em>should</em> really write patches for and submit).</p>

<p>BUT, a couple of days ago I discovered <a href="http://www.gtd-php.com/">gtd-php</a>.  It seems like a more complete (read: strict) implementation of the GTD methodology.  I installed it with ease over at textdrive (it&rsquo;s PHP, so requires none of the proxy-forwarding malarky that Rails needs to run under lighttpd), and have started to use it for work and home(work).  It seems like a good implementation, and I&rsquo;ve experienced few issues with it so far.  The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is the inability to see what contexts exist without pretending to create an action to access them via the dropdown box - I added some, and made a mistake, and had to drop into the database to correct it.  It&rsquo;s quite a new implementation I think, but it looks very promising.</p>

<p>I also got lots of stuff done yesterday.</p>

</a>
Peter Cooper over at <a href="http://rubyinside.com">rubyinside.com</a> has recently blogged about <a href="http://scrubyt.org/">scRUBYt</a> - a new ruby based web scraping toolkit.</p>

<p>It looks super-powerful.</p>

<p>Basically, you define an extractor, which can pull HTML (even including posting form data, such as product searches), click on links, pull content from the page and create XML with it.</p>

<p>What I particularly like about this is now this gives developers the ability to <em>very simply</em> include content from sites that aren&rsquo;t mashup-friendly (ie, REST or SOAP APIs).  I mean, it was of course possible before, but this just seems so much easier.  No-ones content is safe!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been reading The Economist&rsquo;s &ldquo;The World in 2007&rdquo; today.  It looks like their predictions for 2007 in economics, business, politics - sort of a <em>what&rsquo;s going to happen in &lsquo;07</em>.</p>

<p>One thing that I just get this feeling about when I read about the political situation in Europe in terms of predictions (and known events) for &lsquo;07, is that Europe is due some sort of flood of innovation.  I&rsquo;ve been seeing and hearing about the Europeans becoming more and more prevalent on the (please excuse the buzzword) <em>Web 2.0</em> scene, and I just get this sense that something is going to happen this year.  I&rsquo;d like to think that Silicon Valley buzz will die down, in favour of a Silicon Continent buzz.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got little to no evidence to back this hope up, it&rsquo;s just a feeling I have.  It&rsquo;s things like the success of ruby conferences in London and across Europe, some German entrepreneurs I know, the ubiquity and adoption of mobile services in Europe, the socialness of the Europeans, the proximity of so many different cultures and people and the overdueness of such an age.  There is no reason why it can&rsquo;t happen here, and I just feel the time is right.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s just that 2007 seems to be a fairly significant year politically, and there is a lot of change in the air.  I think we&rsquo;ll see some movement from the Europeans in the innovation space.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Disclosure: I work for <a href="http://www.vodafone.com">Vodafone Group Services</a> - but I think this is a great idea regardless)</p>

<p>Vodafone have launched a new developer community site called <a href="http://www.vodafonebetavine.net">Betavine</a> - <a href="http://www.vodafonebetavine.net"> <a href="http://www.vodafonebetavine.net">http://www.vodafonebetavine.net</a> </a>.</p>

<p>From poking around the site, it appears it&rsquo;s a collaboration space for mobile application developers, testers, and anyone interested in mobile communications.  What I&rsquo;m particularly intrigued (and keen to see how it develops) is the mobile art space.</p>

<p>Application developers can also create project spaces, to enable collaboration on mobile communications projects.  So, there are spaces for files, blogging, user forums, private project-only spaces.  Of course, Vodafone reserve some rights, so make sure you&rsquo;re happy with the rules on applications and IPR before you upload - as you should with pretty much anything you do - check the T&rsquo;s &amp; C&rsquo;s.  The developer space doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a traditional software development space (like a sourceforge, or a rubyforge), but more like a file sharing space and promotion space.  I can&rsquo;t confirm this, because I have haven&rsquo;t got a project space yet.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll develop a little something with mojax, and see if I can get it hosted at Betavine.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s also interesting if you&rsquo;re a young fella (or fell&#8217;ess) is that Vodafone are looking to run competitions, and offer internships and externships.  So, get in while the gettings good I say.  I&rsquo;d have liked to have this sort of thing around when I was at uni&hellip;  There are some <a href="http://www.vodafonebetavine.net/web/guest/projects/students/competitions">competitions</a> there now with some healthy looking prizes (Ã¢â€šÂ¬5000 for 1st - awarded to your uni to be shared with you) so check it out.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am very pleased that <em>finally</em>, the company I work for has taken this sort of initiative.  I personally would have liked to see it done earlier, like, when the first round of handsets came out with development environments.  However, software development on handsets has traditionally been complex, time consuming and painful.  BUT, with the emergence of J2ME, and more recently AJAX frameworks for handsets it&rsquo;s becoming a relatively trivial activity.  I doubt the concept would have worked before, but I feel now the time is right.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The emergence of easier development environments.</li>
    <li>The increases in bandwidth in mobile networks.</li>
    <li>The ubiquity of phones in society.</li>
    <li>The innovation and relative tiny amount of capital required to launch web businesses now</li>
</ul>


<p>It all points (in my humble opinion) to an explosion of innovation and development to offer mobile web style services.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling for a long time to find a party, or ideology that I agree with politically.  I have strong beliefs but I have struggled to find a ideology that they fit within.  Today, I discovered it.</p>

<p>I reckon I&rsquo;m a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">Libertarian</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The central tenet of libertarianism is the principle of self-ownership. To libertarians, an individual human being is sovereign over their body, extending to their life, liberty and property. As such, libertarians define liberty as being completely free in action, whilst not initiating force or fraud against the life, liberty or property of another human being. This is otherwise known as the non-aggression principle.</blockquote>


<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I believe.  I like free markets, and non-aggression, and consideration for others liberty (as defined above), and a belief that an individual is responsible for their own actions, and can make their own decisions.  I like the concept of &ldquo;user pays&rdquo;, and I disagree with taxation to fund long term unemployment.</p>

<p>Yep, I&rsquo;m a Libertarian.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, thanks to one of the mailing lists I subscribe to, I learnt about <a href="http://mojax.mfoundry.com/display/mojax/Main+Page">mojax</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mojax.mfoundry.com/display/mojax/Main+Page"><img src="http://mojax.mfoundry.com/download/attachments/6/LargeLogo.png" alt="mojax logo" /></a></p>

<p>mojax is a j2me based AJAX framework for mobile devices.  Essentially the moblets (mojax applications) run within a j2me environment, and are not limited to the usual constraints of mobile web applications brought about by the usually dodgy HTML, CSS + JS support within most mobile devices (barring of course the fantastic <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/">Opera</a> browser).</p>

<p>The mojax environment exists as an Eclipse plugin, and I&rsquo;m downloading it right now.  I plan on blogging a bit about my experience with it.  I&rsquo;ve previously developed applications in j2me environments, and Symbian, and haven&rsquo;t really enjoyed the experience with either.  I find the Symbian model virtually impossible to get my head around - the resources available on the web for learning fundamentals about it don&rsquo;t really exist.  There is not much around that tells you how to structure a mobile application (apart from the split between your UI and your business logic DLLs).  With J2ME, I actually didn&rsquo;t mind developing for it.  But I now use a mac, and no vendors seem to be producing development environments for it, and that to me is 1) astounding and 2) unacceptable.  So, I&rsquo;m looking for something else.</p>

<p>If mojax proves to be as simple to use as I hope (check out the <a href="http://mojax.mfoundry.com/display/mojax/Moblets">sample apps</a> - simple stuff) then it might become the environment that Tomas and I use for the application we are developing.  More on that later hopefully.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you posted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just had my most pleasant experience with Singletons ever.  I had a little problem I was trying to solve in ruby, and I contacted a friend of mine who is quite a good developer.  He suggested I should be looking at global variables, to static (class) variables, or singletons.  I gave globals a go, and they didn&rsquo;t give me the love I expected, so I said &ldquo;bye bye&rdquo; to them - probably never to be used again.  I next tried Singletons.</p>

<p>Ruby defines a Singleton module.  This is mixin&rsquo;d with your code thusly:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Lonely</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Singleton</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Easy peasy.</p>

<p>That, creates a singleton of Lonely for you.  The include modifies the signatures of the new and allocate Class methods (Lonely.new and Lonely.allocate) to be private, and creates (or modifies) some other methods to provide some loveliness (gory details to be found at <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/singleton/rdoc/index.html"><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/singleton/rdoc/index.html">http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/singleton/rdoc/index.html</a></a>).</p>

<p>Basically, then all you need to do is call the instance method of the class you have created.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Lonely</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">instance</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And then you can use m as you like.  You can create more</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Lonely</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">instance</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Lonely</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">instance</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And m and n refer to the same instance.  Nice Singleton.  No need for me to check out class variables.  I think my Singleton will be more portable.  BTW - Don&rsquo;t try to .new your class - you&rsquo;ll get a NoMethodError thrown as the new method has been made private by the mixin.</p>

<p>Ruby rocks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6245851.stm">Taking the Vietnam out of Iraq</a></p>




<p>Jenna sent me a link to this story on the BBC web site - it&#8217;s interesting.  The parallels between the conflict in Vietnam and Iraq are clear to me.  However, an exit strategy for this current conflict needs to be carefully executed.  A cut-and-run is not an option.  The country will be left open, and crippled.  I personally would like the US out of there as soon as possible, not because I have any specific alliance to Iraq, but I just don&#8217;t think they should be creating and sustaining an unjust and illegal war.  I am an advocate of a medium paced exit, with creation of stability within the country, and leaving it in a state so that it has a good chance of sorting itself out with a positive result.  I don&#8217;t fancy the chances of a positive result if they just up and leave.</p>


<p>One thing that is very interesting from this story is this quote:</p>


<blockquote>Second, there is a policy of trying to hand over responsibility to the local government in the midst of battle, not after it - this happened in Vietnam with the policy of Vietnamisation</blockquote>


<p>I agree there is that parallel, but I don&#8217;t think that can be helped with the current conflict.  With such a small, radical, underground enemy as the US have in Iraq, it&#8217;s going to be next to impossible to end the conflict, and then hand responsibility back.</p>


<p>I don&#8217;t believe another push by the US to destroy the insurgents is the way forward.  That will breed more hate and contempt for the US in the country.</p>


<p>Any comments?</p>
