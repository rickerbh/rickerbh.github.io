  <div class="entry-content"><p>(I wrote this on the plane, so things are slightly out of order on my blog&hellip;)<br /><br />I&rsquo;m sitting here on QF190 in business class on my way to Sydney.  I&rsquo;m reading American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis.  I love the style of writing in that book.  The level of description for objects of desire and disgust in that book is astounding.  I thought I might write the rest of this entry in a similar style - if you have read the book or seen the movie, let me know what you think.  If you haven&rsquo;t, you should.  Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m an arrogant mo-fo from this post until you have, and understand the style :-)<br /><br /><br />I did not spend any time in the first class lounge as I ordinarily would as I was spending my time with AMC in the airport, talking.  I also discovered that I am arriving in the UK 3 days before my entry clearance is valid.  That sent me into a panic for 5 or so minutes with associated hot flushes, until we went to the Qantas ticketing counter and talked to the lady there.  I didn&rsquo;t get a good sense of reliability from the advice she offered, which is why I&rsquo;m going to get Qantas to check it all out from the First Class lounge when I arrive in Sydney.  They already provide me with a greater level of trust than the ticketing counter lady, even though I have not seen or asked them to look into it for me yet.<br /><br />I was the 3rd passenger onboard the plane.  When I arrived in the departure lounge the plane was not boarding, even though the television screens said that it was.  I find that very frustrating.  I could have spent more time with AMC had I known that the plane was not <em>really</em> boarding.  When they called the business class, platinum and gold Qantas frequent flyers, and the One World ruby and sapphire (I think) club members, I had had enough of standing around and boarded instantly.<br /><br />After I had been on the plane for around 10 minutes, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the business class cabin was sparsely populated.  I always like <em>not</em> sitting next to someone whilst I&rsquo;m flying, and as a platinum  level frequent flyer <em>and</em> paying for a business class ticket they <em>never</em> put me next to someone else, unless the plane is full.  There is one familiar face on the plane.  I do not know his name, but his face is familiar from the First Class lounge from back when I used to fly to Australia weekly.  I was then offered a tropical fruit fusion, a water or a champagne.  I decided on the champagne, as I always take the champagne on a flight, regardless of the time of day.<br /><br />There are 10 people in the cabin.  The capacity is 30.  4 of the people are a party of 3 women, and a baby.  The baby started screaming on takeoff, which always frustrates me.  I expect to hear that back in economy, but not in business.<br /><br />The hostess after take off came around and offered drinks.  My second drink on the plane is always a G&#8217;n&rsquo;T.  This Qantas flight stocks Tanqueray London Dry Gin, which I enjoy.  It is not the number 10, but even the entry level Tanqueray is a good gin.  I decided on a small bowl of olives over the roasted assorted nuts as a snack.  I enjoy the taste of the olives, and have not had them on a plane as an in-flight snack before - they must be a new addition the the menu.  After the gin and olives, the meal service arrived.  The choices were a Thai Style Yellow Chicken Curry with Steamed Rice and Asian Greens, a Salmon Fillet with Herb Butter and Chat Potatoes, or a Salad of Roast Lamb with Chickpeas, Red Pepper and Tomatoes.  The first two items were served with a Peking Duck and Cucumber Mint Salad, and the Salad was served with a fruit salad.  There bread choice was a wholemeal or white bun.  I was drawn by the Thai Style Yellow Chicken Curry with Steamed Rice and Asian Greens, but eventually decided on the Salmon Fillet with Herb Butter and Chat Potatoes.  I felt like fish over Thai Curry, probably because I had a Thai Green Curry for dinner last night.  When the meal arrived, I had the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.  The salad dressing was too spicy for the meal, and the broccoli was a little overcooked.  The peas were excellent, as were the potatoes in the Herb Butter.  The salmon was to die for - I have never had such a good aircraft Salmon.  Dessert choices were a Selection of Seasonal Cheese and Dried Fruit, Ice Cream with Almond Biscuits, or chocolates.  I always take the cheese over ice-cream.  The platter consisted of an above average cheddar, and an average Camembert.  The dried fruit was <em>an</em> apricot.  There was also a cube of quince jelly, which I enjoyed.  Then I had a 10 year old Penfolds Port, which was of average quality, a coffee, and a macadamia chocolate.<br /><br />I also drank 3 glasses of water as I need to keep my hydration up because I have been dehydrated over the weekend, and 27 hours in an aeroplane is not good for you.<br /><br />:-)</p>

Phwar!  What a crazy, screwed up book.  I did enjoy it however.  I really enjoyed the amount of detail Bret Easton Ellis went into â€“ the descriptive language is what really did it for me.

On my flight from Sydney to Heathrow I had a stopover in Bangkok.  As I was going thru the gate to get back on the plane, the machine that reads your ticket made a funny beep, the lady pulled the ticket out, checked the screen and asked me to stand to one side.  She then tapped away on her computer, wrote on my ticket, and said â€œI&#8217;m very sorry sir, but your business class seat has been allocated to someone else.  I&#8217;m sorry, but we&#8217;ve had to reseat you in first class.â€  I said â€œOK.  That&#8217;s alright.  Thank you.  It&#8217;s really OK.â€.

First class rocks â€“ it was like a 12 hour flight, so being able to lie flat, wearing 1st class pyjamas, with a duvet on the plane was really fun.  The food is better than business class, with more selection.  The chocolates are nicer too.

So, that&#8217;s why seat 4K is better than seat 61A :-)

I knew of Jacqueline du PrÃƒ© from her music, I&#8217;m a big fan of the cello.  I did not however know of the tragic story of her life.  I don&#8217;t know how much of the movie has been dramatised, but she was a brilliant cellist who was cut down way too early.

I really recommend this movie.  I thought it was fantastic.

<div>by Jim Jarmusch</div>

This movie is amazing.  Brilliant soundtrack by RZA of Wu-Tang fame, some beautiful camera shots, and a compelling story.  I love how <a href="http://www.43people.com/profile/view/114178">Jarmusch</a> has crossed over Samurai code to mafia hit men, and how he shows the dedication that Ghost Dog has for his art, belief structure and warrior code.

I really enjoyed it.
