  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m doing a bit of Flash work for a <a href="http://broomemedia.com.au">mate</a> who is setting up a website to host video.  One of the problems I just solved was how to get some text to flow around an image.  I was hoping there would be some sort of way to make a textfield of arbitrary shape (with vectors or something) because I really wanted an L shaped textfield, so I could place an image in the upper left corner, but sadly, they are just rectangles.  I found <a href="http://www.actionscript.org/forums/showthread.php3?t=133932">this post</a> though, and the solution was so simple.</p>

<p>Just convert the textfield to Render text as HTML!  Put your normal HTML tags in, and it&rsquo;s all good bro.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I like about this whole Flash thing - it&rsquo;s very easy to merge the richness of Flash with the simplicity of the web.</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t like is that the content isn&rsquo;t searchable by Mr. Google :-(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, last friday (29th) was my last day at <a href="http://www.vodafone.com/">Vodafone Group Services</a>.  It feels a bit weird not working there anymore, although I don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s really hit me.  After 8+ years in the same group of companies it&rsquo;s just a bit strange to be out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a new role at a consultancy based in London, starting with some intensive training on the 10th March.  Should be very interesting to start working on the other side of the consultant/customer relationship.  I&rsquo;m really looking forward to it - it&rsquo;ll be great to be able to interact with a wider range of companies, industries and perform a much more cross-functional role.  It should be great!  And finally being able to feel like I&rsquo;m delivering value to people and organisations again - that will be the most rewarding part of the move (of course, I <em>have</em> been delivering value for the past 8 years, it&rsquo;s just in the last 2 it&rsquo;s been in a very different way - all advice and recommendations, rather than something tangible).</p>

<p>The biggest thing that I think I&rsquo;m going to struggle with though is having to pay for phone calls!  Spending a long time with free wireless voice and data services builds up some bad habits (from my bank balances point of view!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Arrrrgggg!</p>

<p>When I ordered my MacBook Air the only options I had for keyboard were UK English, and French.  No US English when ordering from the UK store you see.  So, I was trying to hack around with rcov today, and needed to alter some source.  I wanted to copy and edit a line of code, preserving the original.  To do this, I was just going to hash out the line, and put my altered line below.  That&rsquo;s where I encountered my issue.</p>

<p>THE UK KEYBOARD LAYOUT HAS NO # SYMBOL PRINTED ON IT!!!!</p>

<p>Luckily I found <a href="http://www.hutsby.net/2008/01/apple-mac-osx-looking-for-hash-on-uk.html">this</a> page - Hat tip to QuiteTall.</p>

<p><strong>ALT-3</strong> for people who can&rsquo;t be bothered clicking thru.</p>

<p>I mean come on - the keyboard has symbols such as § and ±, but no #?!?!?!?  What&rsquo;s going on with that?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you unfamiliar with the term&hellip;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy">Meritocracy</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/">CotÃ© from Redmonk</a> quoted the title of this entry in episode 14 of Redmonk Radio.  Again, it&rsquo;s another quote that was like an &ldquo;Oh yeah&rdquo; moment for me.  In companies where you produce software (usually) the project timeline or budget is king.  In the open source movement, the best ideas take as long to get implemented as needed - there is no overriding time line that says you must ship that feature by this date.  Also, in distributed projects there can be healthy debate about the best way to implement things - the ideas and implementations with the best merit win.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m slowly catching up on these podcasts - making time on the train to listen is really working out for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Large software vendors do (often in the long term) listen and act on what their customers say they want.  However, implementations are still missing the point.  What customers say they want and what they actually want can be <em>very</em> different things.</p>

<p>Historically people (like me) in enterprises have harped on to vendors for years about how we want their large enterprise applications to be more configuration driven rather than coding driven.  The actual purpose behind this was about time to market, resource availability with the necessary skill sets required to maintain and alter the application, effort around testing and deployment, and certainty about the validity of the syntax and sensibility of the customisation.  Vendors have responded by closing the code base, but offering more complex configuration environments - which is exactly what we have asked for (see next paragraph about how we have asked for the changes).  However, what they have provided doesn&rsquo;t meet the actual business goals of the request.  For example, I&rsquo;ve been recently looking at some Product Configuration software that has a guided Java coding environment for rules definition.  This doesn&rsquo;t actually make the implementation simpler.  It means that your (previously) relatively unskilled (and that&rsquo;s flame bait if ever I&rsquo;ve seen it) configuration staff have to significantly increase their skills to match those of java developers.  Its called &ldquo;configuration&rdquo; because its done in a &ldquo;configuration&rdquo; tool.  The configuration tool is as much a config tool as Eclipse is (which has code completion BTW, is equally applicable for the task, probably nicer to use and definitely cheaper).  What it&rsquo;s done is moved the effort from the development staff, to the configuration staff.  Assuming staff are happy with what they do, developers are unlikely to want to join a &ldquo;configuration&rdquo; team, and configurators are unlikely to want to gain development skills.  One may also argue that your testing and deployment efforts are more difficult, because the coding that was done by people who know how to code, is now done by people who don&rsquo;t know how to code - this in my mind introduces more risk.  You also don&rsquo;t know which parts of the application are affected by this complex configuration activity, and this may drive for <span style="font-style: italic">more</span> rather than <span style="font-style: italic">less </span>regression testing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been reading recently about user stories, which are something I&rsquo;ve never professionally come across.  I&rsquo;ve been working for my entire professional career on waterfall based implementation projects, with requirements and scope specified in documentation like traditional UML use cases, interaction/sequence diagrams, and <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/830-1998_desc.html" target="_blank">IEEE 830</a> style requirements.  I wonder if the large enterprise is its own worst enemy when it comes to vendor software direction and influence.  We are always writing (and that&rsquo;s the first mistake) very specific (and that&rsquo;s the second mistake) requirements for vendors to implement, and influencing them through RFIs and RFPs which contain hundreds or thousands of these requirements.  Maybe if the interaction was more conversation and (business) outcome based we&rsquo;d actually get what we wanted, instead of getting what we write down - which is always going to be flawed (inaccurate, incomplete, technology based rather than business value based, and driving misunderstandings between reader and writer).  Conversations about outcomes are the way to get around the limitations of written software system specifications.</p>

<p>What we actually want and what we get are often different things.  I&rsquo;m beginning to understand that outcome driven conversations between parties playing their specific roles are the way to go.  In a supplier-customer relationship, the customer should tell the supplier what they want to achieve (in a business context), perhaps explaining why the current implementation does not meet their needs.  The suppliers role is to understand the customers issues and the drivers behind why those issues are actually issues, and then propose ways those issues could be resolved.  Often it may be a process or simple usability issue, sometimes there are fundamental issues with the implementation that require longer term efforts to fix.  Regardless, the vendors know their software and the capabilities it possesses and the customers know their business drivers and understand how they are using the software.  Each party should focus on playing their part in the relationship and achieving their eventual outcome (customer = achieving the business value and business purpose they want, and vendor = getting a satisfied customer, which hopefully translates into a big purchase order for them).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That&rsquo;s some strong language there Dr. Drummond.</p>

<p><a title="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/yahoo-and-future-of-internet.html" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/yahoo-and-future-of-internet.html" target="_blank"> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/yahoo-and-future-of-internet.html">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/yahoo-and-future-of-internet.html</a></a></p>

<p>While I am in favour of openness on the internet, I am also against protectionist measures (like <em>enforced</em> competition).  I like the idea that if a company has the resources, they can buy another company.  It is an idea that promotes liberty.  Of course, in a situation like this it appears that openness may be at risk because of the duopoly that will (effectively) be created here.  So, what has more weight?  Liberty for the corporation, or openness and competition on the internet?</p>

<p>On this one, I&rsquo;d be in favour of the openness and competition.  The 3rd large player in this space does promote more competition, as well as another set of &ldquo;standards&rdquo; - IM protocols, interfaces/APIs for services, etc.  I also like <a title="uk.finance.yahoo.com" href="http://hamishrickerby.com/" target="_blank">uk.finance.yahoo.com</a>&rsquo;s streaming stock price service, and it would be a shame if that went the way of the Dodo.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t agree with Microsoft&rsquo;s historical handling of anti-trust situations, and I see that this will happen again in the future.  They seem to be a more litigious organisation than an innovative one, and purchasing the competition only stifles innovation.  Buying complimentary services can help growth, but competing services?  No way.</p>

<p>I think in the long term this deal would be a bad one for the (concept of the)  internet.  But the offer price is very compelling.  Who knows what will happen&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Righto, I&rsquo;ve been putting it off long enough.  <a href="http://gotthegist.co.nz">Got the GiST</a> has been running on rails 1.1.6 almost since it has been launched, and I&rsquo;d like to take advantage on some of that RESTful 2.0 goodness.  So, I&rsquo;ve decided it&rsquo;s time to upgrade it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a couple of issues though.  I currently use (shhhh, I&rsquo;m about to say a dirty word) <em>Engines</em> to handle my user logins and roles&hellip;  They don&rsquo;t work with much past rails 1.1.6.  I also don&rsquo;t have good admin screens on the application, and whenever I need to do maintenance (which is very rare) I need to go and edit the database directly :-(</p>

<p>So, there are a number of things that I want to do to the app.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Upgrade to Rails 2.0.2</li>
    <li>Convert my user login goodies to use <a href="http://technoweenie.stikipad.com/plugins/show/Acts+as+Authenticated">acts_as_authenticated</a></li>
    <li>Get another way to handle roles</li>
    <li>Implement <a href="http://streamlinedframework.org/">Streamlined</a> for admin screens</li>
    <li>Write some tests - I&#8217;ve was a bit slack when I initially wrote <a href="http://gotthegist.co.nz">Got the GiST</a></li>
    <li>Refactor my code - this goes without saying - some of it is a bit shabby</li>
</ol>


<p>The main issue I have is that I&rsquo;m not sure what order I want to do this in.  The issue that I have is there are a number of dependencies.  For example, old-style Engines doesn&rsquo;t work past 1.1.6 - and I have my complete login and role system built around that.  <a href="http://streamlinedframework.org/">streamlined</a> don&rsquo;t appear to work with Rails 1.1.x.  <a href="http://technoweenie.stikipad.com/plugins/show/Acts+as+Authenticated">acts_as_authenticated</a> requires a simple bit of script hackery to work with 1.1.6, so that might be able to come early&hellip;</p>

<p>I think what I&rsquo;m going to do is drop Engines ASAP.  That&rsquo;s the main cause of my pain.  I need to recreate with acts_as_authenticated essentially the same methods for authentication as login_engine currently has, as well as find a (perhaps temporary) solution to my roles issues.  Then I&rsquo;ll set about writing tests.  Next step I think could be to upgrade to 1.2.6, and then implement <a href="http://streamlinedframework.org/">streamlined</a>. I think I&rsquo;ll then be ready for a migration to Rails 2.0.</p>

<p>Unless someone else has a much better suggestion!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was listening to a <a href="http://redmonk.libsyn.com/">Redmonk Podcast</a> on the train on the way home from work today, and James from Redmonk said something that struck a chord with me.  The quote was&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>How many customers really have the requirements of Charles Schwab?  That is an edge case and sometimes large software companies treat these edge cases as if they were the most sensible source of requirements.</blockquote>


<p>This just really gelled with me.  I&rsquo;ve been working for the largest global mobile telecommunications company on earth for 8 years now, and we battle with vendors every day on requirements, features, architectures and roadmaps that we&rsquo;d like them to build into their applications.  What I take from that (and other things I&rsquo;ve been reading and listening to) is that you have to be acutely aware of who your customer base is.  If you are serving the top 5-10 companies in a particular sector in the world, then you can clearly afford to bend to their requirements, because that&rsquo;s what they are paying you for.  If you are trying to hit mass market, don&rsquo;t try and emulate the big boys.  Keep it simple.  Keep the minimum.  Keep the maintenance down.</p>

<p>I guess this aligns well with the philosophy that <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37 Signals</a> use with their rails apps, and also with the way I tried to create <a href="http://gotthegist.co.nz">Got the GiST</a>.  That was an exercise in taking a painful and complex activity (tax preparation) and simplifying it so my mother could use it.</p>

<p>This is also something I need to remember when I start my new job in just over 1 month.  Moving to the vendor/consultant side of the equation is going to be a real eye opener.  I won&rsquo;t always be working with very large enterprises.</p>

<p>The episode was only <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/redmonk/episode02-redmonk.mp3">podcast 2</a> (very old!), I&rsquo;ve only recently been introduced to these guys by a colleague.  I say give them a listen if you&rsquo;re keen for an alternative analysts take on IT and the industry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Economist published a story called &ldquo;<a target="_blank" title="The end of cheap food" href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10252015">The end of cheap food</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It has a couple of interesting quotes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Chinese consumer who ate 20kg (44lb) of meat in 1985 will scoff over 50kg of the stuff this year. That in turn pushes up demand for grain: it takes 8kg of grain to produce one of beef.</li>
    <li>This year biofuels will take a third of America&#8217;s (record) maize harvest. That affects food markets directly: fill up an <span class="scaps">SUV</span>&#8217;s fuel tank with ethanol and you have used enough maize to feed a person for a year.</li>
    <li>Increasing productivity means you need fewer farmers, which steadily drives the least efficient off the land.</li>
</ul>


<p>The first two are interesting for their &ldquo;facts&rdquo;.  The last is interesting because countries in the EU (as I have had it explained to me by British colleagues) will pay farmers to leave land fallow - ie, not grow crops or farm animals - this is in a drive to keep prices up in Europe - sort of a reverse subsidy.  Local suppliers used to be encouraged to produce with subsidies, now foreign suppliers are discouraged (and this is particularly strange in my opinion because a country is giving away money offshore to not produce anything, whereas they could stimulate their own economy by spending the money internally - however this in turn will likely increase efficiency of farms, due to more funds available to farmers for RnD activity).  What I find interesting (and surely obvious to all) is that increases in technology and production methods will yield greater productivity, increasing the supply, and thus, depressing the price even more.  This will in turn require more intervention in terms of subsidies for supply in europe, and subsidies for <span style="font-style: italic">lack of</span> supply in other countries.</p>

<p>And of course, this all hurts the developing nations - they struggle to produce food in a manner that is as productive as the west due to lack of technology and advanced production methods.</p>

<p>The point I want to get across here is that subsidies aren&rsquo;t good for anyone when viewing the global economy.  Subsidies at home encourage oversupply.  Subsidies offshore (for lack of production) artificially raise global prices and is fighting a losing battle due to advancement of production methods and technology.</p>

<p>My view is that if you can&rsquo;t survive at a free market price, then you should seriously consider exiting that market and doing something else with your capital.  Subsidies are not a long term solution.  (Re)Investment is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I had my first experience creating a VERY simple workflow with Automator.</p>

<p><img id="image179" src="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/icalbirthdaysleopard_20071126175350-thumb.jpg" alt="Automator" /></p>

<p>I was editing word documents, excels and powerpoints on my mac and then sending them back to my work PC so that I could embed visio diagrams in them, as well as image files I have on that machine.</p>

<p>I was emailing lots and lots of files, and doing it over and over again, so I thought there must be a better way to do this.  Even Windows has a &ldquo;Send To&rdquo; option in Explorer, so the mighty OSX 10.4 should be able to do that too.</p>

<p>So, to cut a long story short I clicked on Finder in the applications pane, then selected &ldquo;Get Selected Finder Items&rdquo; as the action.  That was dragged over to the workflow area.</p>

<p><img id="image181" src="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/step1.png" alt="Step 1" /></p>

<p>Then, I checked out the actions in Mail.  This was a bit confusing, because initially I tried to run &ldquo;New Mail Message&rdquo;, and then &ldquo;Add Attachments to Front Message&rdquo;.  This second step is unnecessary.  First of all &ldquo;New Mail Message&rdquo; returns &ldquo;Mail Messages&rdquo; and can&rsquo;t be used as input for &ldquo;Add Attachments to Front Message&rdquo;, and secondly files/folders are input to &ldquo;New Mail Message&rdquo; and they are attached automagically.  I then selected my details by clicking on the Address Book icon, and set a subject &ldquo;Files from home&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img id="image182" src="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/step2.png" alt="step 2" /></p>

<p>Third step was to send the message.  The action is called &ldquo;Send Outgoing Messages&rdquo;.  This was dragged over, and then I saved the action as &ldquo;Send Files to Work&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img id="image183" src="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/step3.png" alt="step 3" /></p>

<p>Now I have a shiny new menu item under automator.  Basically any file(s) or folders I want to email to work, I now just right click, go to automator, and click on Send Files to Work.  And off they go!</p>

<p>I will have to play with Automator a little more I think.  I&rsquo;ve had my mac over 2 years now, and this is the first I&rsquo;ve used it.</p>
