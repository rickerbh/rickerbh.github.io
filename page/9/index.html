  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I saw on the iTunes store that Automattic had their wordpress iPhone application released. I promptly downloaded and installed it onto my new phone.  I&rsquo;m writing this entry on it now and it seems pretty good. You can upload photos but I think writing HTML will be a bit of a pain, but for a quick blog post it seems to do the job. I say if you have an iPhone and a wordpress based blog then this is a good application to have, and the price can&rsquo;t be beat.</p>

<p>Update: uploading a photo causes my iPhone to crash. I&rsquo;ll try again :-S Hmmm, it worked that time.</p>

<p>Update 2: now it tells me I have an invalid image, and it won&rsquo;t upload it. I hope they get that sorted soon. No images for you this post sorry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the day reworking <a title="Glimmer Design" href="http://glimmerdesign.com">Glimmer Design</a>.  I always intended to - the template I had on there was good, but not quite what I was after.  I had a think last week about what I&rsquo;d like the site to look like, and I made it today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Homepage</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And the page behind the spanner (yes! that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s supposed to be)</p>

<p>There are 2 things that concern me</p>

<p> </p>

<ol>
    <li>People&#8217;s browser windows may not be big enough for all the content</li>
    <li>The icons down the bottom of the page may be a little obtuse.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve updated Wordpress, AND migrated my two blogs together to be one, again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also tried to support the existing feeds - so I&rsquo;ve got a couple of permanent redirects in the .htaccess files to sort them out.  So, if your feeds don&rsquo;t work anymore, your crappy feedreader doesn&rsquo;t support the HTTP specification correctly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to have a mnenonic password generator for a little application that I&rsquo;m writing in ruby, and couldn&rsquo;t find one out there.  So, I rolled my own.  Actually, it&rsquo;s a knock-off of a <a href="http://homework.nwsnet.de/">Python one I found</a>, but that doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>

<p>Do with this what you will.  Hope it&rsquo;s useful to someone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling to find podcasts that I really dig.  Redmonk radio lost me as a listener.  I thought their early episodes (up to around 40 or so) were great.  A good mix of strategy, business, and IT - in a general sense.  I&rsquo;m quite an enterprise focussed generalist, so that really appealed to me.  However, recently they have released the RIA and IT Management podcasts, and they are not for me at all - so I unsubscribed.</p>

<p>I went looking last night for some new podcasts in iTunes that might appeal to me.  I found a couple, but am still left unimpressed.</p>

<p>What I found was&hellip;</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DeliotteUKInsights">Deloitte UK Insights</a> - Interesting analysis from Deloitte UK - based around their recent releases of sector based 2008 predictions.  I liked this, but I&#8217;d like it to be more frequent than yearly :-)</li>
    <li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/boagworldpodcast?v=2">boagworld.com</a> - not listened yet</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.newworldpodcasting.com/files/tracking/feed/telelogic/57_feed_itunes.xml">Enterprise Architecture with Jan Popkin</a> and <a href="http://www.newworldpodcasting.com/files/tracking/feed/telelogic/53_feed_itunes.xml">Enterprise Architecture: Lessons Learned</a> - thinly veiled sales podcasts from Telelogic - authors of the Popkin System Architect tool (which I personally like as a tool, but not as much as Metis Architect)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/podcasts/feed/rss2">Manager Tools</a> - not listened yet</li>
    <li><a href="http://pragprog.com/podcasts/feed.rss">Pragmatic Programmers</a> - not listened yet</li>
    <li><a href="http://feeds.jabalog.com/telcotalk">TelcoTalk</a> - product reviews, US based, but features some international news.  I think this has promise, but needs to leave just reporting about device press releases and features, and start to comment more on how the devices are unique in the market, their competitors, business value they create etc&#8230;</li>
    <li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/web20Show">The Web 2.0 Show</a> - not listened yet</li>
</ul>


<p>What I&rsquo;m actually looking for is IT / Telecommunications / Enterprise / business / strategy / analysis style talking.  I&rsquo;m not after development podcasts (although the Ruby On Rails podcast is good, and I&rsquo;m expecting PragProg, boagworld and web2.0 show to be similar), but I do enjoy the style of them - talking about new ways of working, the business value of agile methods, interviews with startups and businesses on introduction of new technology into the enterprise etc.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of anything that will fit the bill?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m doing a bit of Flash work for a <a href="http://broomemedia.com.au">mate</a> who is setting up a website to host video.  One of the problems I just solved was how to get some text to flow around an image.  I was hoping there would be some sort of way to make a textfield of arbitrary shape (with vectors or something) because I really wanted an L shaped textfield, so I could place an image in the upper left corner, but sadly, they are just rectangles.  I found <a href="http://www.actionscript.org/forums/showthread.php3?t=133932">this post</a> though, and the solution was so simple.</p>

<p>Just convert the textfield to Render text as HTML!  Put your normal HTML tags in, and it&rsquo;s all good bro.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I like about this whole Flash thing - it&rsquo;s very easy to merge the richness of Flash with the simplicity of the web.</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t like is that the content isn&rsquo;t searchable by Mr. Google :-(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, last friday (29th) was my last day at <a href="http://www.vodafone.com/">Vodafone Group Services</a>.  It feels a bit weird not working there anymore, although I don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s really hit me.  After 8+ years in the same group of companies it&rsquo;s just a bit strange to be out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a new role at a consultancy based in London, starting with some intensive training on the 10th March.  Should be very interesting to start working on the other side of the consultant/customer relationship.  I&rsquo;m really looking forward to it - it&rsquo;ll be great to be able to interact with a wider range of companies, industries and perform a much more cross-functional role.  It should be great!  And finally being able to feel like I&rsquo;m delivering value to people and organisations again - that will be the most rewarding part of the move (of course, I <em>have</em> been delivering value for the past 8 years, it&rsquo;s just in the last 2 it&rsquo;s been in a very different way - all advice and recommendations, rather than something tangible).</p>

<p>The biggest thing that I think I&rsquo;m going to struggle with though is having to pay for phone calls!  Spending a long time with free wireless voice and data services builds up some bad habits (from my bank balances point of view!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Arrrrgggg!</p>

<p>When I ordered my MacBook Air the only options I had for keyboard were UK English, and French.  No US English when ordering from the UK store you see.  So, I was trying to hack around with rcov today, and needed to alter some source.  I wanted to copy and edit a line of code, preserving the original.  To do this, I was just going to hash out the line, and put my altered line below.  That&rsquo;s where I encountered my issue.</p>

<p>THE UK KEYBOARD LAYOUT HAS NO # SYMBOL PRINTED ON IT!!!!</p>

<p>Luckily I found <a href="http://www.hutsby.net/2008/01/apple-mac-osx-looking-for-hash-on-uk.html">this</a> page - Hat tip to QuiteTall.</p>

<p><strong>ALT-3</strong> for people who can&rsquo;t be bothered clicking thru.</p>

<p>I mean come on - the keyboard has symbols such as § and ±, but no #?!?!?!?  What&rsquo;s going on with that?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you unfamiliar with the term&hellip;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy">Meritocracy</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/">CotÃ© from Redmonk</a> quoted the title of this entry in episode 14 of Redmonk Radio.  Again, it&rsquo;s another quote that was like an &ldquo;Oh yeah&rdquo; moment for me.  In companies where you produce software (usually) the project timeline or budget is king.  In the open source movement, the best ideas take as long to get implemented as needed - there is no overriding time line that says you must ship that feature by this date.  Also, in distributed projects there can be healthy debate about the best way to implement things - the ideas and implementations with the best merit win.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m slowly catching up on these podcasts - making time on the train to listen is really working out for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Large software vendors do (often in the long term) listen and act on what their customers say they want.  However, implementations are still missing the point.  What customers say they want and what they actually want can be <em>very</em> different things.</p>

<p>Historically people (like me) in enterprises have harped on to vendors for years about how we want their large enterprise applications to be more configuration driven rather than coding driven.  The actual purpose behind this was about time to market, resource availability with the necessary skill sets required to maintain and alter the application, effort around testing and deployment, and certainty about the validity of the syntax and sensibility of the customisation.  Vendors have responded by closing the code base, but offering more complex configuration environments - which is exactly what we have asked for (see next paragraph about how we have asked for the changes).  However, what they have provided doesn&rsquo;t meet the actual business goals of the request.  For example, I&rsquo;ve been recently looking at some Product Configuration software that has a guided Java coding environment for rules definition.  This doesn&rsquo;t actually make the implementation simpler.  It means that your (previously) relatively unskilled (and that&rsquo;s flame bait if ever I&rsquo;ve seen it) configuration staff have to significantly increase their skills to match those of java developers.  Its called &ldquo;configuration&rdquo; because its done in a &ldquo;configuration&rdquo; tool.  The configuration tool is as much a config tool as Eclipse is (which has code completion BTW, is equally applicable for the task, probably nicer to use and definitely cheaper).  What it&rsquo;s done is moved the effort from the development staff, to the configuration staff.  Assuming staff are happy with what they do, developers are unlikely to want to join a &ldquo;configuration&rdquo; team, and configurators are unlikely to want to gain development skills.  One may also argue that your testing and deployment efforts are more difficult, because the coding that was done by people who know how to code, is now done by people who don&rsquo;t know how to code - this in my mind introduces more risk.  You also don&rsquo;t know which parts of the application are affected by this complex configuration activity, and this may drive for <span style="font-style: italic">more</span> rather than <span style="font-style: italic">less </span>regression testing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been reading recently about user stories, which are something I&rsquo;ve never professionally come across.  I&rsquo;ve been working for my entire professional career on waterfall based implementation projects, with requirements and scope specified in documentation like traditional UML use cases, interaction/sequence diagrams, and <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/830-1998_desc.html" target="_blank">IEEE 830</a> style requirements.  I wonder if the large enterprise is its own worst enemy when it comes to vendor software direction and influence.  We are always writing (and that&rsquo;s the first mistake) very specific (and that&rsquo;s the second mistake) requirements for vendors to implement, and influencing them through RFIs and RFPs which contain hundreds or thousands of these requirements.  Maybe if the interaction was more conversation and (business) outcome based we&rsquo;d actually get what we wanted, instead of getting what we write down - which is always going to be flawed (inaccurate, incomplete, technology based rather than business value based, and driving misunderstandings between reader and writer).  Conversations about outcomes are the way to get around the limitations of written software system specifications.</p>

<p>What we actually want and what we get are often different things.  I&rsquo;m beginning to understand that outcome driven conversations between parties playing their specific roles are the way to go.  In a supplier-customer relationship, the customer should tell the supplier what they want to achieve (in a business context), perhaps explaining why the current implementation does not meet their needs.  The suppliers role is to understand the customers issues and the drivers behind why those issues are actually issues, and then propose ways those issues could be resolved.  Often it may be a process or simple usability issue, sometimes there are fundamental issues with the implementation that require longer term efforts to fix.  Regardless, the vendors know their software and the capabilities it possesses and the customers know their business drivers and understand how they are using the software.  Each party should focus on playing their part in the relationship and achieving their eventual outcome (customer = achieving the business value and business purpose they want, and vendor = getting a satisfied customer, which hopefully translates into a big purchase order for them).</p>
