My friend Jenna is doing an Honours degree at the university of Canterbury.  She is taking some film papers, and seems to be quite a cinemophile (did I just make up a word?).  When I was down there she was shocked at the lack of movie watching I did, so I committed to her that I would watch a list of movies that she&#8217;s given me.
FWIW, the list is here.  If there&#8217;s a movie you think should be on it, let me know and I&#8217;ll pitch it to her for adding.

<div>

racc is the rubyised implementation of lex/yacc.  I want to learn this as I&#8217;ve got some file parsing that needs doing, and this is the <em>proper</em> way to parse files.  It&#8217;s a lot of guesswork at the momentâ€¦
Check <a href="http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/racc/">http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/racc/</a> to see what I&#8217;m on about.

<div>Yesterday on the plane back from my holiday in Christchurch, I finished the functional aspects of my application that I&#8217;m developing.Today, I made it aesthetically pleasing.  The application is ready for testing.  I&#8217;m going to ask my friend Yanti who works for Unisys as a tester in Wellington to test the application out. 

There are some things I need to do as well.
<ul>
    <li>Go see an accountant about company structures</li>
    <li>Go and get a terms of service statement from a lawyer</li>
    <li>Find a CMS to help me maintain a â€œbusinessâ€ web site</li>
    <li>Find a product name.</li>
</ul>
That&#8217;s about it really.  Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to finish this off.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Grrr, just spent a little while playing with the &ldquo;select&rdquo; form tag in rails.  Pain in the ass.  The issue I was having is that I want to give users an option of 2 values with a default selected value on the &ldquo;new&rdquo; form.  I also have a edit form that I want to let users update their objects with, and again, only 2 values.  These values are static, and I didn&rsquo;t want to have the pain of creating a db table, and an object to represent it.  That would result in unnecessary code, and unnecessary database hits.</p>

<p>The issue with the &ldquo;select&rdquo; tag is that I cannot determine how to set the selected value, without using a collection of objects.  I had a look for a solution for this problem, and found <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/HowtoUseFormOptionHelpers">this site</a>.  This gave me a helper that lets me put in an object, with some methods to get the value and text options for my option set.  that was alright.  But, I didn&rsquo;t want the full object model to be supported.  I was after a very simple implementation with using a hash, and a string as the selected value.</p>

<p>I hacked around with the code, and this is what I came up with.  Please feel free to pillage this.</p>

<p>def hash_select_with_current(object, method, hash, current_value)
  result = &ldquo;<select name=\"#{object}[#{method}]\">&rdquo;
  hash.each do |key, value|
    if current_value == value
      result &lt;&lt; &ldquo;<option selected=\"selected\" value=\"#{value}\">#{key}</option>&rdquo;
    else
      result &lt;&lt; &ldquo;<option value=\"#{value}\">#{key}</option>&rdquo;
    end
  end
  result &lt;&lt; &ldquo;</select>&rdquo;
  return result
end
&#8220;`</p>

<p>Hope that&rsquo;s useful for someone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I picked Sarah up from her Mums place, and we went round to Jenna&rsquo;s place.  We started on some wine, and ended up playing some drinking games.  We decided to jump the fence at the botannical gardens in christchurch, and go drinking in there.  We did that, I snapped some good nighttime pics - available as always on my <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/rickerbh/'>flickr</a> site.  I had a good time.  Sarah then decided that she wanted to leave, and I walked her back to Jennas to get her stuff and a taxi for her.  Long story short, she spiked her leg on the fence and we <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/rickerbh/78453160/'>ended up in A&amp;E</a> at <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/rickerbh/78453637/'>Christchurch Hospital</a>.  We stayed there for about 90 minutes, then Sarah went up and asked how long the wait was going to be.  There was a sign we had missed, and it said there was a 6 hour average wait.  Seriously, there were like 10 people waiting - and 6 hours!  I found that absolutely shocking.  Anyway, we packed that in, and went to the 24 hour clinic - Sarah had to pay, but didn&rsquo;t wait 6 hours.  She got 5 stitches.<p>Crazy night.<p>Got some good photos tho, particularly the one of <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/rickerbh/78452334/'>June and Leif</a> in the dark - June with her phone, and Leif with a cigarette.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went out to Andy and Jeanettes (Mr and Mrs Barrett) tonight for a BBQ and some beers.  They got a new BBQ a wee while ago with some department store vouchers they got from their wedding.  Nice BBQ actually - 4 burner masport thing.  <p>So, we christened it - it hadn&rsquo;t been used before.  It was also Andrews first time (I think) as chief BBQ&#8217;er - he did a good job  for his 1st time.  He discovered that if you have crumbed food on his BBQ, you need oil :-)<p>After dinner, we played Monopoly.  Andrew is a big star wars fan, and Jeanette got him Star Wars monopoly for Xmas.  So we played that.  It appears the rules for monopoly have changed from the edition I used to play on.  My father has a monopoly set from the 1950&rsquo;s - it&rsquo;s quite cool.  The standard rules that are different now are whenever you don&rsquo;t buy a property you land on, it goes to auction.  Highest bidder gets it.  Also, taxes from the board and fines from community chest don&rsquo;t go into the middle of the board - they just go back to the bank.  On my fathers version, if you get fined the money goes into the middle of the board and when you land of free parking, you get the $$$.<p>Because it&rsquo;s the star wars edition, they have some new rules.  The most notable new rule is what happens when you throw a double.  Usually when you throw a double, you get to throw again.  With this game, you can either throw again, or &ldquo;use the force&rdquo;.  Each double enables you to do something different.  eg, double 1 = move anywhere on the board.  Double 3 is get a sith card (old community chest).  The best one is double 6.  If you throw a double 6, you can challenge anyone for a property they own that they don&rsquo;t own the complete set of.  You each take a die, and highest roll wins.  If the challenger wins, the get to take that property.  If the defender wins, they don&rsquo;t lose the property - it&rsquo;s quite good.  Of course, with my bad luck I was 0 for 2 on that.<p>Jeanette got bored near 10pm, and decided that she&rsquo;d sell me all of her property for $200.  She donated all of her cash to Andrew.  I was clearly losing the game, but with her cards I had the majority of the property - and my average property value would have been higher than Andrews.  We played till 10pm, added up, and declared it a draw.  My net worth would have been slightly ahead, but that&rsquo;s only because I got a whole stack of property for real cheap.  I had quite a fun time.<p>I stayed late into the night, and ended up staying here.<p>Got to go back to my parents soon - I should be seeing my friend Sarah T from Wellington tonight.  She&rsquo;s in Christchurch until the 28th.  I think Jenna, Hayley, Sarah and I will be having another boozy evening at Jennas.  Last time we did this was about 1 year ago, and Sarah and I got Hayley quite trashed playing Gravy Train - hehehe.<p>Holidays = a chance for me to give my liver some exercise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went out to the Christchurch International Airport today, and got to see the fire engines&hellip;  There are about 5  big engines down there.  Got to go for a ride on one of the runways in the fancy new engine - $1.2m purchase price, around $300k commissioning cost.  It carries around 10k litres of water.  The main water cannon can shoot water up to 70 metres.  VERY impressive.  I got to control the cannons - that was quite cool.  They were surprisingly responsive.  There are a couple of joysticks - one for the nose mounted cannon, and one for the top mounted one.  Very good.<p>The new truck has around 680hp, and weighs 33 tonnes.  It has quite good acceleration given its weight.<p>Big thanks to Richard and his father for letting me go out there.<p>Pictures on <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/rickerbh/'>flickr</a>.</p>
