  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had some great news last week. A previous client asked me to submit a quote for the full version of a prototype iOS app I had created for him last year. I submitted the proposal, but had assumed he was using it to benchmark other application development companies against. To my surprise, he accepted my proposal, and awarded me the work. It&rsquo;s a substantial piece of work, and technically quite challenging. It also has the potential to be a big innovation on the space it&rsquo;s in, so is exciting from that aspect too.</p>

<p>So, I accepted. The issue for me is that this puts my other project on hold for a few months. However, income is good, and this will let me work for longer on my project after I&rsquo;m done, so it&rsquo;s a positive move.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I alluded to in a <a href="/2011/10/24/work-plans/">previous post</a>, things like User Experience, Human Computer Interaction, and Graphic Design are not my fortes. All my professional software experience until I started iOS development was either in developing (~2 years) or designing/architecting (9+ years) large scale telecommunications software systems (specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_support_system">BSS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_support_system">OSS</a> systems if you&rsquo;re interested). These sorts of systems do not have pretty user interfaces - there is no need to provide them. In fact, the majority of systems I have designed only have human interactions with back-office operators who are Unix system administrators - the main &ldquo;user&rdquo; of the system would typically be another system.</p>

<p>The users of my new software will be proper &ldquo;end-users&rdquo;. People who do not use computers for a job. People who are unsure, or even wary about computers for fear of breaking them. People who do not know commands like <code>kill -9</code> when something isn&rsquo;t working, or even how to drive a CLI.</p>

<p>It would be delinquent of me to not take some advice from well respected professionals in this space. So, I read some books. (<em>I will take some advice from actual people later, but as a first step I think education is always a good step.</em>)</p>

<h2>Designing Interactions by Bill Moggridge</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0262134748?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hamishrickerb-21&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=3194&amp;creative=21330&amp;creativeASIN=0262134748&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;qid=1325142051&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon UK</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262134748/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hamricsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0262134748">Amazon US</a></p>

<p>I actually got this book expecting it to have practical advice on how to design software products, and was (pleasantly) surprised when it didn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a collection of interviews (and then analysis and commentary on the interviews) with a set of influential product designers. There is a strong bias towards IDEO, but I guess that&rsquo;s to do with the authors familiarity with the organisation. The book gives insight into the interaction design processes used to create some very popular products, as well as covering some things that haven&rsquo;t worked. It gives you a good idea of how the designers <em>think</em> about problems - which is great to understand as an outsider to this world.</p>

<p>The two parts of this book that stick with me are Terry Winograd&rsquo;s discussion on Mark Weiser&rsquo;s <em>ubiquitous computing</em> - the idea that people don&rsquo;t want to interact with computers - they want to get something done. The computer is an instrument to be used to get something done - the purpose is not to interact with the computer, but to achieve a goal. The other part was John Maeda&rsquo;s Laws of Simplicity. These eight laws are about making complex systems simpler for users, either by relating functions, using knowledge that users already have, and recognising when materials (technology in my case) is inappropriate for a task, either by it being too hard to use, or breaking &ldquo;laws&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>TOG on Interface by Bruce &ldquo;TOG&rdquo; Tognazzini</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0201608421?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hamishrickerb-21&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=3194&amp;creative=21330&amp;creativeASIN=0201608421&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;qid=1325143254&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon UK</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201608421/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hamricsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201608421">Amazon US</a></p>

<p>I got this book because of the Apple Macintosh legacy the author has. Bruce Tognazzini developed the first set of Human Interface Guidelines for Apple in the late 70&rsquo;s, and was involved with the Macintosh UI which still has a significant influence on the modern interface we use on OSX. The book is a collection of his writing for the Apple Direct publication as well as other text gathered or produced for this book. The book was written in 1992 (updated in 1996 - 15 years ago!) but remains relevant. The principles are as relevant today as they were way back in the 90&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Three things made this book useful to me. The first are all Bruce&rsquo;s Principles and Guidelines (which are outstanding) and the collection of them in the appendix. This gives you an overview (and shortcut to relevant places in the book) for each item he discusses in the book. The second is (and this may sound odd given I&rsquo;ve used a mac now for 5 years) he describes what the ellipsis means in a Mac menu or on some buttons. I remember seeing it, but I never thought about why it is there. It means that a window or pane will pop up asking for more information before the action you have requested will be executed. This is all about letting users know they can experiment with the system and be assured they can get out again without making any changes. This was a little UI thing I just hadn&rsquo;t consciously grasped the meaning of, and it&rsquo;s just nice to understand why it&rsquo;s there and what it means. The third thing was the in-depth discussion about the Conceptual Model a user generates when they interact with a system. This was like a lightbulb going off for me. This is such a fundamental part of any system and user interface design. It&rsquo;s obvious it happens (users have a view of what systems do, which may or may not be correct), and designers need to cater for this - exposing elements to users that influence that conceptual model, to make it easier for users to understand and interact with the system. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of thoughts on this so may write another entry on it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I would definitely recommend both books to anyone involved with software product design - I&rsquo;m not sure how much new information there will be for experienced UE practitioners, but I&rsquo;m sure there are some useful nuggets in both for all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the last post and this one, we&rsquo;ve moved 10500 miles (that&rsquo;s nearly 17,000 kilometres!) and only yesterday got all our utilities sorted out, meaning that I&rsquo;ve basically been offline (bar mobile phone for the past 3 weeks). Melbourne is fantastic. I really like it here.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been doing a little bit of work on my application, mostly completion of the requirements, data model, and competitor analysis, as well as reading up a bit on UX and Mac way of doing things (I&rsquo;ll probably cover this in another entry), and most recently have been prototyping some code that I thought would be particularly tricky.</p>

<p>What this code does is synchronise data across other applications on your mac, with my (intended) application. The reason behind this was to make the act of populating my application with data, and keeping the data fresh over time, simpler for users - or as John Maeda states in his Second Law of Simplicity:</p>

<blockquote><p>The positive emotional response derived from a simplicity experience has less to do with utility, and more to do with saving time.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m into saving time for my (future) happy users, and reusing data that is already on their Mac helps with this - they don&rsquo;t need to double key or manually join-the-dots between the applications.</p>

<p>The prototyping I was creating was using ScriptingBridge to access data that&rsquo;s available in other applications that a user may use. The prototype was going well - I had managed to get some queries and filtering down from 5 minutes to 90 seconds to 6 seconds which was a nice level optimisation, and although there are some issues with ScriptingBridge, it was going to let me do what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>One of the key things with the distribution of this application for me is to have it in the Mac App Store. New mac users are a growth market (look <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/12/apple-set-to-break-record-for-mac-sales-this-fall-report/">at</a> <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/11/14/apple_on_pace_to_sell_record_5_3m_macs_in_holiday_quarter.html">the</a> <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/12/12/quarterly_us_mac_sales_up_13_expected_to_grow_in_december.html">stats</a>), and Apple is pushing them down the Mac App Store route to discover and purchase applications. Not having the app in the Mac App Store would be foolish from my perspective.</p>

<p>Today, I was seeing how I could get the application working under sandboxing - as this is now a requirement for new Mac Apps. It&rsquo;s all about making applications safer for users in terms of the resources they can use in terms of network, disk access etc (<em>although some <a href="http://blog.wilshipley.com/2011/11/real-security-in-mac-os-x-requires.html">prominent developers</a> aren&rsquo;t convinced</em>).</p>

<p>I was sad to discover that ScriptingBridge is precisely one of the technologies that is hit hard by the sandboxing. Basically, applications can receive AppleEvents, send AppleEvents to themselves, and respond to AppleEvents they receive (<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/AppSandboxTemporaryExceptionEntitlements/AppSandboxTemporaryExceptionEntitlements.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011195-CH5-SW1">source</a>). The upshot of this is that AppleEvents are pretty useless in a environment of sandboxed applications, as you can only send them to yourself (and no-one else can send them to you).</p>

<p>There may be a way around this - Temporary Exceptions to the AppleEvent sending issue. You can obtain a temporary exception to send AppleEvents to other applications through the <code>com.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events</code> key-value pair in your Entitlements file. The main issues I see with this are:</p>

<ol>
<li>They are likely to attract more attention in the review cycle - this in general is a good thing as it&rsquo;s important that Apple check what your application is doing to ensure that it&rsquo;s being a good citizen. However, this is likely to slow down the review process and I suspect guidance on what&rsquo;s acceptable is not consistently applied.</li>
<li>They are <em>temporary</em> - Apple could disallow/reject them in the app updates, or just remove the function. The clue is in the name, people.</li>
<li>The intent behind the exception - I suspect that the intention behind the temporary exception is to allow pre-existing applications to migrate to a 100% compliant sandboxing world over time, not for new applications. Approval is at risk here, and I don&rsquo;t want to sink significant effort into getting rock solid sync only to be told it&rsquo;s not allowed.</li>
<li>The overall future of AppleEvents - this (in my mind) is a clear intention that AppleEvents will not have a strategic future at Apple, and that existing applications may drop support for them as no sandboxing compliant applications can actually use the functions. It seems to me risky to use a technology that seems to have a limited future.</li>
</ol>


<p>This leaves me with two options. I can either remove the synchronisation functionality from the application, or I can distribute it outside the Mac App Store. My wife actually suggested a third - do both. I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do. Mac App Store is first priority, and depending on the markets response, I&rsquo;ll look at options for data synchronisation.</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s a massive PITA.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I attended <a href="http://www.onedotzero.com/">onedotzero</a> at the British Film Institute. I was invited by <a href="http://alphalabs.cc">alphalabs.cc</a> to their launch event, in conjunction with Microsoft and Nokia.</p>

<p>It was pitched as &ldquo;an experiment that merges technology and the arts&rdquo; - and this blend (to me at least) is intriguing. Since I discovered &ldquo;creative coding&rdquo; I have been fascinated by the experimental applications that fit in this space, so didn&rsquo;t want to miss out on this event. <em>I have no idea how I got an invite&hellip; I wonder if it was because I&rsquo;m a Nokia dev member, or because I have previously been active on the oF forums, or maybe I was just very lucky.</em></p>

<p>Some marketing and community/dev evangelist type people talked for a bit, and they weren&rsquo;t over the top with pushing WP7.5 - which was good. There was a lot of talk about the lineage of the Metro design (that I found very interesting) - Metro is a relatively unique looking interface, and has some new ideas and interactions in it - so it was nice to hear how it was conceived.</p>

<p>Then, they pulled up 3 teams of developers and designers to talk about the applications they had made over the last two weeks - essentially showcasing the WP7.5 development environment (ease of use, speed, different technologies etc). This was the most interesting part for me. The applications were</p>

<ol>
<li>a music app that collaboratively generated music across 4 synchronised phones - <a href="http://www.alphalabs.cc/project/69-vequencer">Vequencer</a></li>
<li>a music video/game in which you take the form of a 3D shape and can shift gravity and change shapes to navigate through the levels - <a href="http://www.alphalabs.cc/project/70-redshift">Redshift</a></li>
<li>a kaleidoscope app merging video and generative art that changes based on environmental factors such as motion and sound - <a href="http://www.alphalabs.cc/project/68-kaleidobooth">Kaleidobooth</a></li>
</ol>


<p>The applications themselves were quite impressive, but what impressed me more is that the team that did the second app (<a href="http://www.field.io/">Field</a>, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>, and <a href="http://xna-uk.net/blogs/braindump/default.aspx">Ed</a> from the XNA Users Group) had no experience with the WP7 <del>or XNA</del> development environments previously, and managed to create a 3D game in 2 weeks, with excellent graphics and sound. Very impressed.</p>

<p>And to top it all off, I got a free phone :-) Nokia Lumia 800 - it&rsquo;s actually really nice. Screen is brilliant.</p>

<p>AND alphalabs are running a little competition too - app development - cash prizes. Doesn&rsquo;t appear to be on their website yet, but I recall it closes in early Jan-2012.</p>

<hr />

<p>(Update 20111128 - Ed from XNA User Group was also part of team two - thanks for the update Tristan!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve started the feature &amp; function planning for my application - or really, I&rsquo;ve started to identify the requirements for it. I&rsquo;m starting by evaluating existing applications in the marketplace, considering the functions they support, the data they collect, and how the user navigates through the application. So far, I have about 300 screenshots from various applications,  strewn all over the floor of my office, and 4 coloured pens for me to mark up the screenshots. The colours refer to the following areas of requirements or commentary.</p>

<ol>
<li>Brick red - bad UI</li>
<li>Blue - data to collect</li>
<li>Green - good UI</li>
<li>Pink - application function, feature, or derived data</li>
</ol>


<p>The functions are further classified into &ldquo;things that should be there for a first release&rdquo; and &ldquo;things that can wait until later&rdquo;.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m looking for now is a sensible way to capture and manage all this information. Carrying around 300 pages of screenshots is just silly. I could have electronically marked up the Keynote presentation rather than do this on paper, but I don&rsquo;t see myself reusing the information if it&rsquo;s stored in that format.</p>

<p>As part of a contract my company has right now, I&rsquo;m using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_engineering">CASE</a> tool for a project with a client. The business analysts on this project are tracking all requirements, use cases and UI modules within a tool called Enterprise Architect by Sparx Systems. I&rsquo;m currently leading the technical workstream and we are also using it to produce our technical application design. It seems like a very comprehensive tool, but it&rsquo;s Windows only. I&rsquo;d love for a tool like that to be native on the Mac.</p>

<p>Other CASE and UML tools I&rsquo;ve used in the past are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Popkin System Architect (became Telelogic, then IBM and consumed into the Rational suite)</li>
<li>Rational Rose</li>
<li>ArgoUML</li>
<li>Troux Architect</li>
<li>Various Eclipse plugins</li>
</ul>


<p>The issue I have with all of these is that it seems they will be disconnected from the development workflow if you use a mac, or are working on a non-Java project. These tools are supposed to help with the development process, but I can&rsquo;t see how that will work if they aren&rsquo;t connected to it. Yes, I understand the value in the whole planning and design side, but the disconnect to development seems large. If I didn&rsquo;t care about having the process connected, I&rsquo;d just use OmniOutliner as I have in the past for other personal projects - it can track requirements, feature/release planning, data model elements etc. But because of the potential size of this application, I feel I should be using something more structured.</p>

<p>Maybe the project should change to creating a decent CASE tool for the Mac :-)</p>

<p>At the moment the plan is to use Enterprise Architect, and we&rsquo;ll see how that goes. One good thing is that I can export data out of it if the process doesn&rsquo;t work out, so there will be little wasted effort.</p>

<p>If anyone has used CASE tools on the mac for Objective-C based projects, I&rsquo;d love to hear what was used, and how the experience was - good or bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://jacquesmattheij.com/It+takes+three+years+to+build+a+business">Three years</a> eh? I&rsquo;m planning 6 months.</p>

<p>I guess the key difference here is that I&rsquo;m not planning on having any employees at 6 months. I don&rsquo;t plan on being able to replace the lucrative contracting I&rsquo;ve been doing either. In fact, I don&rsquo;t really expect any sales at 6 months.</p>

<p>What I am aiming for is to have a software product that I believe has a future. If, 6 months in, I have something that I can start to sell and get feedback on, I&rsquo;ll be a very happy man.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The product I&rsquo;m going to make could be very large. There are loads of features it could support, but one of the first jobs I need to do is decide what it must do for a first release, that delivers value to customers. I&rsquo;ve started getting in touch with small business people that I know to understand what they would value in such a product, but there are just so many diverse suggestions, even when I&rsquo;ve given them initial scope for what I think the first release could do. I find myself thinking &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy, that&rsquo;ll only add a day or two&rdquo; to certain features, but I&rsquo;m fairly confident when it comes time to design these things, the duration and complexity will explode.</p>

<p>One thing that is common in pharmaceuticals (<a href="http://twitter.com/mrsrickerby">@mrsrickerby</a> works in that industry, so I have a little understanding of how things work there) is that a &ldquo;Core Data Sheet&rdquo; - aka a core product specification - is written before and during development and testing of the product . This document specifies <em>needs</em> and <em>wants</em> which at the end of each phase of development are used as the yardstick to make go/no-go decisions. For example, if you want to show a 5% improvement in some disease state but your phase 2 study doesn&rsquo;t achieve this, you stop development. It is a living document which, as data is collected, the actual product profile is documented which ultimately becomes the package insert (the bit of paper in the box).</p>

<p>This made me think about how I can manage my scope. The main marketing materials for me will be (1) a web site and (2) the Mac App Store description. I figure that writing the app store description will be the most effortless way to describe the product, the problem it solves, and how it solves that problem for the customers. If I can&rsquo;t write down the very simple things like what problem this solves, and how it does it, then I should stop right now.</p>

<p>I think this also aligns with something I read recently (<em>although I swear I&rsquo;ve read this before months and months ago&hellip;</em>) from the world&rsquo;s toughest programmer, <a href="http://twitter.com/bmf">Mike Lee</a>. <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/09/app-genius-mike-lee-talks-prod.php">App Genius Mike Lee Talks Product Engineering</a> mentions that you should produce some marketing materials (he suggests a video) to explain why people should buy your product. I don&rsquo;t plan on making a video, but the app store description fulfils the same purpose, and I&rsquo;d argue that it&rsquo;s more valuable, as it saves on a job later as it will be refined over time.</p>

<p>This is the approach I&rsquo;ll be taking to my scoping.</p>

<ol>
<li>Define the problem my customers are experiencing</li>
<li>Describe how my software solves those problems for them</li>
<li>Scope the software to solve those problems, and eliminate unnecessary features (and <em>keep</em> them out!)</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of moving to Melbourne, I need to decide what I&rsquo;m going to do to generate income. Traditionally I would either take a Senior Solutions Architect or Enterprise Architect job in a telco, or look for an equivalent role contracting. I think that&rsquo;s not going to be the case quite yet.</p>

<p>After talking to <a href="http://twitter.com/mrsrickerby">@mrsrickerby</a> at the pub about this (all our big decisions are made at the pub), we collectively decided that I am going to continue to work for myself. Not as a contractor though, but trying to create a sustainable software company, that is more than a 1 man band.</p>

<p>Ever since I attended university, I have wanted to make software products for small businesses. I really believe the small business segment is underserved by existing products in the marketplace, and given the size of these organisations (1-10 people is the company/customer size I&rsquo;d want to target), software and computers need to get out of the way and let the people run their businesses, rather than manage and maintain software. This is also probably the last opportunity I&rsquo;ll ever have to give a project of this magnitude a go. I expect we&rsquo;ll be looking to settle down soon, get a family home, big mortgage etc and I can&rsquo;t take risks like this when I&rsquo;d have all that to lose. It&rsquo;d be unfair on everyone involved.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ll be working for 6 months when we arrive in Australia, at home, by myself, trying to create a product to help small business people run their businesses, as unobtrusively as possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also be enlisting the help of some friends. I can design software and systems very well, but user experience, graphic design, copywriting and the like are not my forte. Luckily I know some people in these areas, and I&rsquo;ll be drawing on their knowledge and skills too.</p>

<p>So, the 6 months starts in the New Year (2012) and if by June 2012 and it looks like I could have something to replace the contracting work I&rsquo;d alternatively be doing, I&rsquo;ll be continuing on with the product. The alternative isn&rsquo;t bad - it&rsquo;s just not my dream.</p>

<p>Luckily I&rsquo;ve managed to save up a runway of cash from working in the UK, and my wife is getting a good salary too, so we won&rsquo;t be eating pot noodles to make the $$$&rsquo;s stretch. My wife is very supportive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Big changes are taking place. My wife <a href="http://twitter.com/mrsrickerby">@mrsrickerby</a> and I have decided that we are going to move to Australia. Well, not so much that we are going to move to Australia, more like we <em>are</em> moving. At the start of December 2011. To a city I have never been to before. <a href="http://g.co/maps/2k9vr">Melbourne</a>.</p>

<p>The rationale behind the move is that we would both like to be closer to our families. We&rsquo;re both from New Zealand, and the UK for us was only ever temporary. We&rsquo;ve been here 5 years, and it&rsquo;s time to move on. We&rsquo;ve had a good time here. <a href="http://g.co/maps/knxa2">Reading</a> is the place I&rsquo;ve spent the 3rd most time in, only being beaten by <a href="http://g.co/maps/kyvuq">Auckland</a> (if you count living in a hotel in <a href="http://g.co/maps/wbjmb">Sydney</a> for 9 months as living in Auckland), and <a href="http://g.co/maps/yrk8s">Christchurch</a> where I spent just over 21 years.</p>

<p>My wife has a job organised there, but I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m a telco consultant, and have worked for myself for the past 18 months or so doing this, as well as developing iOS applications for myself and the occasional client. I really like software product development, and would like to do more of this. Melbourne isn&rsquo;t the best city in Australia for what I do (Sydney would be a more sensible choice for my work), but it&rsquo;s probably time for a change, or at least, a commitment to try something I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for a long time.</p>

<p>More soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I have been doing some localizations of an iOS app from English (US) to English (UK). The iPhone development guides from Apple describe how to support multiple languages (such as English, German, Japanese), but fail to describe how to support multiple variants of a single language. By this I mean support support for US English, English, NZ English, AU English. The word I needed to regionalize was Behavior (or Behaviour, depending where you come from).</p>

<p>In the Apple Developer Library, it explicitly states that for MacOS applications take both the Language and Regional preferences of the user into account, but only look at the preferred <em>language</em> on iOS - <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/Articles/InternatSupport.html">Support for Internationalization</a>.  This means that a single variant <em>per language</em> is supported.</p>

<p>However, these is a way around this. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is a <em>good</em> thing to do, but it works for me and I haven&rsquo;t noticed any ill side effects yet.</p>

<p>To support both US English and British English in your iOS application, create 2x Localization.strings files just as you would for multiple language. Put the US English translation file Localization.strings in a directory in your iPhone app called English.lproj (Apple defaults) and the British English translation in a directory named en_GB.lproj (just in case they decide to support regions in the future).</p>

<p>Then, you&rsquo;ll need to create some code to manually set the preferred localization. In your main.m file (yup, main.m is being edited) alter it so it performs some logic similar to below.</p>

<p>When the line</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>gets executed, it seems to set up all the Localization bundles before calling the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method on your app delegate, so putting Localization code in the app delegate is too late. So, what the code above does is retrieve the users current language and region, and compares those against pre-determined values - en for the language and gb for the region. If these match, then I force a new setting in the NSUserDefaults to overwrite the users preferred language. Then, when the UIApplicationManager function gets called, it appears to retrieve the users preferred language setting, and look up the Localization for that - which in my case I&rsquo;ve forced to be en_GB.</p>

<p>One thing you need to be careful about is persistence of this NSUserDefault setting.  It is saved once it&rsquo;s set, and persists through multiple application executions. To get around this (lets say the user changes their region back to US), you need to remove the setting after the bundle initialization has taken place.  In you app delegates application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method, just execute the following code.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objective-c'><span class='line'><span class="p">[[</span><span class="bp">NSUserDefaults</span> <span class="n">standardUserDefaults</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="nl">removeObjectForKey</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;AppleLanguages&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This wipes out the NSUserDefault setting that the app made in the main.m file.</p>

<p>If anyone knows of issues with this approach (apart from being a dirty hack), or faults with my code please let me know in the comments below. I wish Apple supported different regions per language natively in iOS but they don&rsquo;t. This is the only way I&rsquo;ve found to do this, and continue to use localization functions such as NSLocalizedString.</p>
