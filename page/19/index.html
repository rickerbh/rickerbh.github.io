  <div class="entry-content"><div><div><p>I got one of the girls I work with to come out sunglasses shopping with me last week.  Went down to a parallel importer on queen street, and they didn&#8217;t have anything I was interested in.  I wanted some more fashionable glasses, not sports styled glasses.  I already have some adidas ones, but I felt I needed a change.</p>  <p>So, into Sunglass Hut on Queen Street, have a look around, and I get very confused.  I found it very difficult to determine which glasses are for which sex &#8211; there are some obvious female-themed glasses, but the mens ones are more difficult to distinguish.  So, I speak to the clerk, and she gets me out quite a few pairs.</p> <p>Long story short, the first pair I try on are the best.  <a href="http://www.framesdirect.com/framesfp/D_G-lbmfph/lb.html">D&#38;G 2075&#8217;s</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://www.framesdirect.com/cdimages_lg/DandG_2075S.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p>Nice.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=2338745">find new sunglasses</a></div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went to the Museum here today.  I was astounded.  It is so very good.  I&rsquo;ve been living here for just over 6 years now and had never been.  My mate Dave asked me if I wanted to go to see the Da Vinci machines exhibition and I am quite keen to see that.  Anyway, I met him down at Santos (a local cafe), we had a late lunch, bit of a chat then made our way down to the Auckland War Memorial Museum.  We arrived down there at about 3.  After a quick chat to the guy who was taking the $5 donation to get in, we discovered that the line for the exhibition was about 1 hour long&hellip;  So, we decided to have a look around the rest of the place then check out the line again.  It&rsquo;s a very good museum.  Anyway, we were having a look around, about a 1/3 of the way around the 3rd floor they announced that the place was closing in 5 minutes.  We didn&rsquo;t even get to see the whole place.  Anyway, I&rsquo;d be quite keen to go back, and the Da Vinci machines closes on the 5th of March.  It has late night on Wednesday, so perhaps that&rsquo;s a plan for after work.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve gotta check out more places of cultural significance in this city.  I think next on the list will be the Art Gallery.</p>

<div>

hehehe.  I really enjoy rock bands fronted by women (eg, <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=Elastica&amp;product=album">elastica</a>, <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=garbage&amp;product=album">garbage</a>, <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=veruca+salt&amp;product=album">veruca salt</a>), but have only really listened to british chick rock, not really american.  I understand Morningwood come from New York, they are a 4 piece rock band with a female singer.

My favourite 2 tracks off this album are â€œNth Degreeâ€ â€“ which is the single I heard on Juice here (one of our MTV-type channels) and â€œJetsetterâ€.

The music has a very new wave and punk type feel about it â€“ which kind of explains why I like it so much.  Also, Nth Degree (for me at least) has a similar feel to some of the <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=Saint+Etienne&amp;product=album">Saint Etienne</a> tracks off <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item/view/61921">Good Humor</a>.

Anyway, I&#8217;m super impressed by these guys.  I hope they get the airplay they deserve.

  <div class="entry-content"><div>
<div>

On my trip to wellington last weekend Johnny (the younger brother of a friend I was staying with) suggested I might want to check out <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=calexico&amp;product=album">Calexico</a>.  I got a hold of 2 of their albums, one is a joint effort with <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=iron+%26+wine&amp;product=album">Iron and Wine</a> (who I also really like a lot), and the other is Calexico alone.

If you&#8217;re into folk guitar type sounds (Iron and Wine, Belle &amp; Sebastian [twee pop â€“ but a similar sound]), Sufjan Stevens etc) I can highly recommend <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item/view/51390">In The Reins</a>.  The album <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item/view/62745">Feast of Wire</a> was a more interesting mix, which I&#8217;m lead to understand is more core Calexico.  Jazz, Afro-Latin, and acoustic guitar blend with beautiful voices to create a masterpiece.  I&#8217;m quite impressed.

  <div class="entry-content"><div><div><p>quite well I felt.  They have already organised for me to speak to the &#8220;Group Resourcing and Talent Management&#8221; (of course, I am talent!) liason again.  He started asking about visas and everything, I was a bit unclear about my situation.  I found out as I was walking home that my grandfather was born in <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/103029">South Africa</a> (I always thought he was born in <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/104704">Newcastle</a>).  However, because of South Africas relatively late independence, and a change in immigration law in the UK, I might still be able to swing a visa thru him or my father.  Anyway, the company indicated that it would be no issue to hook me up with one.  I just can&#8217;t be in the country when they file the application.</p>  <p>Fingers crossed!

<div>by Snakefarm</div>
 
<div>

That&#8217;s how I found it.  The album left me feeling quite empty.  Like I hadn&#8217;t really been listening to anything.  The only track I actually enjoyed off the album was â€œBlack Girlâ€, and I think the reason for that was because I really like the Nirvana acoustic version â€œWhere did you sleep last nightâ€ from their Unplugged album.

I was recommended this album by a friend, and she&#8217;s not usually wrong about music that I&#8217;ll like.

I was quite disappointed.
